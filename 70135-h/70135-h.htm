<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>My friend Ahmed Hassanein has asked me to write a few words of
introduction to his record of a remarkable voyage of exploration.
It was the more remarkable because the expedition, the results of
which have enabled him to fill up an important gap in our knowledge
of Africa and to determine with precision positions only
approximately ascertained by that great pioneer in African
research, Gerhardt Rohlfs, was conceived and led by him
single-handed without other assistance or companionship than that
of his guides and personal attendants.</p>

<p>A traveler whose work has been recognized by the award of the
Founder’s Medal of the Royal Geographical Society should need no
introduction to the British public. But I welcome the opportunity
of drawing attention to his achievement in another field, in the
production of a book which will, I feel sure, be acknowledged by
all who read it to have exceptional interest, written in a language
of which he has made himself a master, although it is not his
own.</p>

<p>But first, disregarding any protests from his characteristic
modesty, I have to present the author himself, who is only known to
the majority of my countrymen as an intrepid traveler. I have had
the pleasure of his acquaintance for a number of years, since he
was the contemporary and friend of my son at Balliol. After
considerable experience I have come to the conclusion that the
experiment of sending students from the East to reside at a Western
university is one which should only be tried in exceptional cases
and with young men of exceptional character. In the case of Ahmed
Hassanein I think all who know him will agree that it has been an
unqualified success. He has retained all that is best of his own
national and spiritual inheritance, while he has acquired a
sympathetic understanding and appreciation of the mentality and
feelings of men with very different social antecedents and
training. It is possible that the blood of his Bedouin forefathers
made intimacy with them easier for him, since the Briton and the
Bedouin not infrequently find in one another a certain kinship of
instinct which compels their mutual regard. Incidentally it may be
mentioned that Ahmed Hassanein represented the University of Oxford
as a fencer. In any case it is possible for him to be a sincere
Egyptian patriot and none the less to entertain equally sincere
friendship with members of the nation to which justice is not
always done by the Younger Egypt.</p>

<p>He began his career at home in the Ministry of the Interior at
Cairo. During the war when martial law was in force in Egypt he was
attached to General Sir John Maxwell, a very old friend of his
country. Now he has entered the diplomatic service, for which a
wide experience of life, rare in so young a man, as well as his
linguistic gifts, eminently qualifies him. He has occasionally
consulted me as an elder friend and as the father of my son on
certain matters of personal interest to himself. I may therefore
claim to know him intimately, and I cannot refrain from recording
my testimony that in all such questions, and especially in a very
delicate matter which he submitted to me, I have always found him
generous in his judgments and, for I know no other way of
expressing what I mean, a great gentleman.</p>

<p>The story of his exploration of desert tracts unknown to
geography and his discovery of two oases whose existence was only a
vague tradition is the record of a great adventure of endurance. It
is told so modestly and with such sober avoidance of overstatement
that readers who have no experience of the vicissitudes of desert
travel may perhaps hardly realize what courage and perseverance its
successful accomplishment demanded. There is also another virtue
besides these which is indispensable for penetration into regions
where the isolated inhabitants regard every intrusion with profound
suspicion, and that is one which Hassanein appears to possess
instinctively, the virtue of tact.</p>

<p>English readers are perhaps rather disposed to think of the
desert in the terms with which romance has made them familiar, for
which the grim reality offers little justification. There is indeed
a romance of the desert, the romance of loyalties and sacrifices
under the shadow of the inevitable, which is an element in the true
romance. And that will not be found lacking in a book which bears
upon it the impress of truth, interpreting the beauty which the
desert can assume, the spiritual influence and inspiration of the
great solitudes, the perpetual consciousness prevailing there of
the narrowness of the border line between life and death.</p>

<p>Apart from its intrinsic interest as a record of discovery and
the light which it throws on the origin, teaching, and influence of
the Senussi fraternity, this volume will be welcome to many because
its pages carry the reader away into the atmosphere of a great
peace. He will be aware for a while of an ambience where the coarse
and the trivial and the competitive do not exist. He will find
himself in touch with men who, unconscious of the urge and tumult
of a world for which they would have no use, lead strenuous but
dignified contemplative lives. And as he perceives how for them
privation and danger and even routine are illuminated by the
conviction of unalterable faith in the guiding hand of Providence,
he will probably formulate the silent hope that these dwellers in
the lonely places may be left untouched by the invasion of the
modern spirit. Their pleasures are as touchingly simple as their
thoughts. These thoughts and these simple pleasures we may for a
passing hour share as they are presented to us by a hand which
seems to me to have an unerring touch in conveying fidelity of
outline and color.</p>

<p>In conclusion it is a grateful duty to add that Hassanein Bey
has more than once confirmed to me in conversation what is
suggested in the dedication of his book, namely that he could not
have undertaken his adventurous journey without the assistance and
support which he received from his sovereign. The promotion of
enterprise is no doubt an inherited impulse in King Fouad, and it
is gratifying to feel that his encouragement may confidently be
anticipated for that scientific and historical research for which
Egypt still offers such an ample field.</p>

<p>The achievement of Hassanein Bey and the spirit in which his
book is written cannot fail to appeal to the sympathies of my
countrymen, and he has added another to his services by thus
promoting the spirit of good feeling between the country of his
education and the land of his birth which all are anxious to see
restored.</p>

<h2>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</h2>

<p>I am deeply indebted to Dr. John Ball, O.B.E., Director of
Desert Surveys of Egypt, who has been good enough to summarize the
scientific results of my expedition in the First Appendix to this
volume. His advice and the instruction which he gave me in the use
of scientific instruments were invaluable. I was indeed fortunate
in being able to draw upon his great knowledge.</p>

<p>The maps of my journey, one of which accompanies this volume,
were kindly prepared by Dr. Ball and Mr. Browne and other members
of the Survey Department of Egypt.</p>

<p>Dr. Hume and Mr. Moon of the Geological Survey of Egypt
classified the geological specimens which I brought back and
prepared a report which is contained in the Second Appendix to this
book. By this willing assistance they added much to the results of
my expedition.</p>

<p>Lewa Spinks Pasha, D.S.O., and Meshalani Bey of the Ordnance
Department of the Egyptian War Office were responsible for the
cases and containers and other camp equipment which I used. These
proved to be satisfactory in every way, and I am grateful for the
care and thought which were expended in their preparation.</p>

<p>My old friends Sayed El Sherif El Idrissi and his son Sayed
Marghanny El Idrissi again gave me that good counsel and ready help
which I had received from them in the course of my trip to Kufra in
1921.</p>

<p>Throughout my expedition I received the most friendly and
effective assistance from Colonel Commandant Hunter Pasha, C.B.,
D.S.O., late Administrator of the Frontier Districts
Administration; Colonel M. Macdonnell, late Governor of the Western
Desert; Major de Halpert of the F.D.A.; Captain Hutton, O.C.,
Sollum; Captain Harrison, O.C. Armored Cars at Sollum; Abdel Aziz
Fahmy Effendi and A. Kmel Effendi, Mamurs of Sollum and Siwa;
Lieutenant Lawler, O.C., Siwa.</p>

<p>When I reached the Sudan my way was made easy and pleasant by
the kindness of his Excellency Ferik Sir Lee Stack Pasha, G.B.E.,
C.M.G., Sirdar and Governor-General of the Sudan, and I cannot let
this opportunity pass of expressing my cordial thanks to all the
officials of the Sudan Government along my route, and especially to
Lewa Midwinter Pasha, C.B., C.M.G., C.B.E., D.S.O., Acting
Governor-General of the Sudan; Lewa Huddleston Pasha, C.M.G.,
D.S.O., M.C., Acting Sirdar; Kaimakam M. Hafiz Bey, O.C. Troops at
Khartum; H. A. MacMichael, D.S.O., Assistant Civil Secretary;
Captain J.E. Philips, M.C. Samuel Atiyah Bey, M.V.O., and Ahmed El
Sayed Pifai of the Sudan Civil Service; Charles Dupuis, Acting
Governor of Darfur; Sagh A. Hilym, S.O., El Fasher; J.D. Craig,
O.B.E., Governor of Kordofan; Bimbashi A. Khalil, S.O., El Obeid;
and the officers, officials, and notables of El Fasher and El
Obeid.</p>

<p>To Bimbashi G. F. Foley, M.C., O.C. Artillery at El Fasher, I am
grateful for the verse which adorns the last chapter of the
book.</p>

<p>I am particularly indebted to Harold Howland and to W. H. L.
Watson, an old Balliol friend, for their invaluable help and advice
in the preparation of this book.</p>

<h2><a id="chap01"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="sub_chapter">THE DESERT</p>

<p>On my first trip through the Libyan Desert I took a vow.</p>

<p>We had lost our way, and we had lost all hope. There was no sign
of the oasis we sought, no sign of any well near-by. The desert
seemed cruel and merciless, and I vowed that if ever we came
through alive I would not return again.</p>

<p>Two years later I was back in the same desert, at the same spot
where we had lost our way, and landed at the same well that had
saved our lives on the previous occasion.</p>

<p>The desert calls, but it is not easy to analyze its attraction
and its charm. Perhaps the most wonderful part of desert life is
the desert night. You have walked the whole day on blistered feet,
because even walking was less painful than riding on a camel; you
have kept up with the caravan with eyes half shut; you follow
mechanically the rhythm of the camels’ steps. Your throat is
parched, and there is no well in sight. The men are no more in the
humor to sing. Their faces are drawn with exhaustion, and with eyes
bloodshot they keep a vague, hopeless look on the ever faint line
between the blue of the sky and the dull yellow of the sand. The
sheepskin water-vessels dangle limply on either side of the
camels.</p>

<p>We do not talk very much in the desert. The desert breeds
silence. And when we are in trouble we avoid one another’s eyes.
There is no need for speech. Everybody knows what is happening, and
everybody bears it with fortitude and dignity, for to grumble is to
throw blame on the Almighty, a thing that no Bedouin will do. To
the Bedouin, this is the life that was intended for him; it is the
route that God decreed him to take; maybe it leads to the death
that the Almighty has chosen for him. Therefore he must accept it.
No man can run away from that which God has decreed, says the
Bedouin. “Wherever you may be, Death will reach you. . . even
though you take your refuge in fortified towers.”</p>

<p>But it is at such times as these that you vow, if your life is
spared, that you will never come back to the desert again.</p>

<p>Then the day’s work is at an end. Camp is pitched. No tents are
erected, for the men are too exhausted, too careless to mind what
happens to their bodies. And night falls. It may be a starlit
night, or there may be a moon. Gradually a serenity gets hold of
you. Gradually, after a day of silence, conversation starts. Feeble
jokes are cracked. One of the men, probably the youngest of the
caravan, ventures a joke with more cheerfulness than the rest, and
his voice is pitched in a higher key. Unconsciously the Bedouins
attune their voices to that higher, louder pitch, and the volume of
sound increases. The desert is working her charm.</p>

<p>The gentle night breeze revives the spirits of the caravan. In a
few minutes the empty <i>fantasses</i> are used as drums, and there
is song and dance. At the first sound of music men may have been
tending the camels, repairing the luggage or the camels’ saddles,
but that first note brings all the caravan round the embers of the
dying fire. Every one looks at his comrades to make sure that all
are alive and happy; and every one tries to be a little more
cheerful than his neighbor, to give him more confidence. There is a
game of make-believe, a little ghastly in its beginnings. We force
ourselves to be cheerful, to make light of our troubles. “The
camels are all right; I saw to that wound, and it is not so bad as
I thought,” says one. “Bu Hassan says he has sighted the landmark
of the well not far to our right,” says another. We work ourselves
up by degrees to a belief that everything is really all right. It
is bluff, maybe, from beginning to end, but the charm of the desert
has prevailed.</p>

<p>It is as though a man were deeply in love with a very
fascinating but cruel woman. She treats him badly, and the world
crumples in his hand; at night she smiles on him, and the whole
world is a paradise. The desert smiles, and there is no place on
earth worth living in but the desert.</p>

<p>Song and dance take out from the men of the caravan the little
vitality that is left after the ravages of the day. Their spirit is
exhausted, and they fall asleep. They sleep beneath the beautiful
dome of the sky and the stars. Few people in civilization know the
pleasure of just sitting down and looking at the stars. No wonder
the Arabs were masters of the science of astronomy! When the day’s
work is done the solitary Bedouin has nothing left but to sit down
and watch the movements of the stars and absorb the uplifting sense
of comfort that they give to the spirit. These stars become like
friends that one meets every day. And when they go, it is not
abruptly as when men say farewell at a parting, but it is like
watching a friend fade gradually from view, with the hope of seeing
him again the following night.</p>

<p>“To prayers, O ye believers; prayers are better than sleep!” The
cry comes from the first man of the caravan to awake. A few stars
are still scattered in the sky. The men get up, and there is
nothing better illustrates the phrase “collect their bodies.” Every
limb is aching, and again their throats are parched. Yet what
changed men they are! There is hope in them, confidence, perhaps an
inward belief that all will come well.</p>

<p>The world then is a gray void, and only the morning fire breaks
the cold north breeze. Our eyes instinctively turn to the east
where the sun is rising. If there are no clouds, there comes a
yellowish tinge in the sky that throws a curious elusive, elongated
shadow behind camels and men, so faint that you can scarcely call
it a shadow at all. Then comes a reddish tinge that gives warmth.
It is just between dawn-break and sunrise that there is color in
the desert. Once the sun is risen there is nothing but the endless
stretch of blue and yellow, and the blue fades and fades until by
midday the sky is almost wrung dry of color.</p>

<p>Morning brings new vitality; night brings peace and serenity.
These are the hours wherein one learns the desert’s charm.</p>

<p>In the silence of these vast open spaces human sensitiveness
becomes so sharpened that eventually the desert traveler feels the
nearness of some inhabited oasis. Likewise his instinct tells him
of the few hundred miles that separate him from any breathing
thing. In the silent infinity of the desert, body, mind, and soul
are cleansed. Man feels nearer to God, feels the presence of a
mighty Power from which nothing any longer diverts his attention.
Little by little an inevitable fatalism and an unshakable belief in
the wisdom of God’s decree bring resignation even to the extent of
offering his life to the desert without grudge. There are times
when he feels that it really does not matter. . . .</p>

<p>The desert brings out the best that is in every man.
Civilization confronts the crowd with danger, and each one fights
for himself and his own safety. In the desert self becomes less and
less important. Each tries to do the best he can for his comrades.
Let disaster threaten a caravan, there may be one man who can see a
chance to save himself, but I do not believe there is a Bedouin who
would desert his comrades and so save his own life. One of the most
appalling things that can happen in the desert is a shortage of
water, and you would think that in such a case you would try to
keep what water you have for yourself. Instead of that, you find
yourself with your favorite water-bottle, taking it in your arms,
going round the men asking would any of them like a drink, as
nonchalantly as though there were plenty of it and to spare. The
question of personal safety is eliminated. Whatever happens, let it
happen to the whole caravan; you do not want to escape alone. That
is the feeling that gets hold of you.</p>

<p>MAP OF THE LIBYAN DESERT</p>
</div></div>

<p>I never cease to marvel at the Bedouin serenity and courage,
which nothing disturbs. In desert travel there are three elements:
camels, water-supply, the guide. Camels, the best of them, and for
no apparent reason, give in, as it happened when I left Kufra and
one of my best camels died on the second night, while, on the other
hand, the weakest camel of the caravan, which left Kufra tottering
under its load, went through the whole trip, about 950 miles, and
arrived tottering at El Fasher. “God will protect it,” said its
Bedouin owner when rebuked for bringing such a sorry animal, and in
truth God did protect it. The death of a camel is a serious matter,
for it means throwing away most, perhaps the whole, of its load.
Water is carried chiefly in sheepskins, and the best of sheepskins,
tested for days and weeks beforehand, have suddenly started to leak
or the water to evaporate from them; or in night trekking two
camels may bump together and cause one or two sheepskins to burst.
And then the guide, for various reasons, may say that his head has
gone round and round, which means he has lost his head; if there
are clouds that hide the sun for a few hours, or one mistake in a
landmark, it may cause the guide to lose his way. But there is one
thing still more necessary than these three items: camels, water,
guide. It is Faith, profound and illimitable Faith.</p>

<p>The desert can be beautiful and kindly, and the caravan fresh
and cheerful, but it can also be cruel and overwhelming, and the
wretched caravan, beaten down by misfortune, staggers desperately
along. It is when your camels droop their heads from thirst and
exhaustion; when your water-supply has run short and there is no
sign of the next well; when your men are listless and without hope;
when the map you carry is a blank, because the desert is uncharted;
when your guide, asked about the route, answers with a shrug of the
shoulders that God knows best; when you scan the horizon, and all
around, wherever you look, it is always the same hazy line between
the pale blue of the sky and the yellow of the sand; when there is
no landmark, no sign to give the slightest excuse for hope; when
that immense expanse looks like, feels like a circle drawing
tighter and tighter round your parched throat—it is then that the
Bedouin feels the need of a Power bigger even than that ruthless
desert. It is then that the Bedouin, when he has offered his
prayers to this Almighty Power for deliverance, when he has offered
up his prayers and they have not been granted, it is then that he
draws his <i>jerd</i> around him, and, sinking down upon the sands,
awaits with astounding equanimity the decreed death. This is the
faith in which the journey across the desert must be made.</p>

<p>The desert is terrible, and it is merciless, but to the desert
all those who once have known it must return.</p>

<h2><a id="chap02"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class="sub_chapter">THE PLANNING OF THE JOURNEY</p>

<p>This is the story of a journey which I made in 1923 from Sollum
on the Mediterranean to El Obeid in the Sudan, some two thousand
two hundred miles. In the course of it I was fortunate enough to
discover two “lost” oases, Arkenu and Ouenat, which previously had
not been known to geographers. My journey was primarily a
scientific expedition, but I have tried in this book to avoid
wearying the reader with technical matter and to write a
straightforward narrative which may be of some interest even to
those who are not acquainted with Egypt, the Sudan, or the Libyan
Desert.</p>

<p>It had always been my greatest ambition to penetrate to Kufra, a
group of oases in the Libyan Desert, which had only once been
visited by an explorer. In 1879 the intrepid German, Rohlfs, had
succeeded, but he had barely escaped with his life, and all his
note-books and the results of his scientific observations were
destroyed.</p>

<p>In 1915 I had been fortunate enough to meet in Cairo Sayed Idris
El Senussi, the famous head of the Senussi brotherhood, when he was
returning from a pilgrimage to Mecca. The capital of the Senussi is
Kufra, and when in 1917 I went on a mission to Sayed Idris with
Colonel the Honorable Milo Talbot, C.B., R.E., a distinguished
officer, who had retired from the Egyptian Army but had returned to
the service during the Great War, and renewed my acquaintance with
that notable man at Zuetina, a little port near Jedabia in
Cyrenaica, I seized the opportunity and told him of my
ambition.</p>

<p>Sayed Idris was most sympathetic and asked me to let him know
when I proposed to make the expedition, so that he might give me
the help and countenance without which a journey to Kufra could not
be undertaken. I met him again at Akrama near Tobruk and told him
then that I would set out as soon as I was free from my war duties.
At Tobruk, Francis Rodd, an old Balliol friend, was with me, and we
decided that we would go together.</p>

<p>When the war was over Mrs. Rosita Forbes (now Mrs. A. McGrath)
brought me a letter of introduction from Mr. Rodd and asked that
she might join us. We proceeded to plan an expedition <i>à
trois</i>, but, when the time came, Mr. Rodd was prevented from
making one of the party. Finally in 1920 Mrs. Forbes and I set out
by ourselves, and with the friendly cooperation of the Italian
authorities and the promised countenance and assistance of Sayed
Idris—he provided us with our caravan—we reached Kufra in January,
1921.</p>

<p>But this trip to Kufra, interesting as it was, only tempted me
to explore the vast unknown desert which lay beyond. There were
rumors, too, of “lost” oases which even the people of Kufra knew
only by hearsay and tradition, and I returned to Cairo resolved to
make another expedition and instead of coming straight back from
Kufra, as Mrs. Forbes and I had done, to strike south across the
unknown desert until I came to Wadai and the Sudan.</p>

<p>Again on the first trip our only scientific instruments were an
aneroid barometer and a prismatic compass. It was not, therefore,
possible for me to make exact scientific observations, and all that
I brought back was notes for a simple compass traverse of the route
based on the meager material I had obtained. I was eager to check
Rohlfs’s observations and to determine once and for all the place
of Kufra on the map.</p>

<p>In 1922, then, I submitted my plan for a journey across the
desert from the Mediterranean to the Sudan to his Majesty King
Fouad I, who had been gracious enough to display his interest in my
first trip by decorating me with the Medal of Merit. He sympathized
warmly with my project, directed that I should be given long leave
of absence from my official duties, and later caused the expenses
of the expedition to be defrayed by the Egyptian Treasury. Indeed,
my expedition could not possibly have met with the success that it
did, had it not been for his Majesty’s invaluable support.</p>

<p>I completed my preparations, and in December, 1922, I had
collected my baggage in the house of my father so that in
accordance with the ancient practice of my race it might be blessed
before I set out on my expedition across the Libyan Desert.</p>

<h2><a id="chap03"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="sub_chapter">THE BLESSING OF THE BAGGAGE</p>

<p>“Allah yesadded khatak—may God guide your steps.” The Arabic
words fell reverently on the air of the great bare room, where
candlelight and clouds of drifting incense contended for supremacy.
Along the walls bulked a strange collection of baggage: big boxes,
little boxes, sheepskin water-bags, tin <i>fantasses</i> for
carrying water, stuffed food-sacks, bales of tents, carrying-cases
of leather and metal containing scientific instruments, and my own
personal kit. After the bustle of getting everything corded and
tied and strapped and arranged in order, a hush had come as we took
our stand in the middle of the room. Outside, the Egyptian night
had fallen, and across the garden the faint hum of the evening life
of Cairo entered our windows.</p>

<p>We were three: myself; Abdullahi, a Nubian from Asswan, who was
to be one of my most trusted men; and Ahmed, also from Asswan,
looking half a wreck after a spell of city life as he stood beside
us, but later to prove himself an excellent cook and on the trek
“the life of the party.”</p>

</div>

<p>Before us stood a tall old man with white flowing beard dressed
in a deep orange-colored silk <i>kuftan</i>. His delicately
wrinkled features spoke of the peace that comes with saintliness.
His long slim fingers clicked softly against each other the amber
beads of a rosary. The white smoke from the incense in the
wrought-silver censer, held by a servant beside him, mounted in a
delicate spiral. The saintly man put aside his rosary and lifted
his hands, palms upward, toward heaven. His voice, thin with age
but clear with conviction, sounded the prayer for those about to go
upon a journey.</p>

<p>“May God guide your steps, may He crown your efforts with
success, and may He return you to us safe and victorious.”</p>

<p>He went round the room, swinging the censer rhythmically before
each pile of baggage and uttering little prayers. This was the
traditional ceremony of the blessing of the baggage, made sacred by
ages of Arab usage at the setting out of a caravan. It has largely
fallen into disuse in these latter days, but in the house of my
father, who walks through life deeply absorbed in scholarship and
the faith of the Prophet, it was the most natural thing in the
world, when the only son was going forth into the desert.</p>

<p>As I stood before the saintly man to receive his blessing, I was
no longer an Egyptian of to-day but a Bedouin going back to the
desert where his father’s fathers had pitched their tents.</p>

<p>Then I turned and went to my father.</p>

<p>For fifteen years, since I had been sent to Europe for my
education, our ways had rarely met. Sometimes I wished that I had
studied the subjects in which he was interested so that I might
profit by his profound learning.</p>

<p>“He is going to live in another generation; let him get the
education he will need for it,” my father had said once of a
fellow-scholar of mine. But now when I was returning to the desert
from which our forefathers had come we knew what was in each
other’s minds and understood.</p>

<p>After a moment’s silence, he put his hands on my shoulders and
prayed, “May safety be your companion, may God guide your steps,
may He give you fortitude, and may He give success to your
undertakings.”</p>

<p>The baggage blessed, Abdullahi and Ahmed took the heavy stuff
and set out for Sollum, leaving with me the scientific instruments
and the cameras for more careful handling. On December 19 I left
Alexandria by boat for Sollum.</p>

<h2><a id="chap04"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class="sub_chapter">SUPPLIES AND EQUIPMENT</p>

<p>The twenty-first found me disembarking at Sollum, which is a
tiny seaport close to the western frontier of Egypt. There we were
to take camel and go by way of Jaghbub to Jalo, the important
center of desert trade where our own caravan would be organized and
the great trek southward begun. A journey like this of mine always
has several starting-points, each with its own variety of emotions
and experiences. In the dimly lighted, incense-scented room in my
father’s house the enterprise was a kind of dream, fascinating in
its possibilities but hardly yet real. At Sollum came the practical
reality of assembling stores and equipment, packing and repacking
to get everything into the smallest compass and most convenient
shape for handling, checking it all over to make sure that nothing
had been forgotten, and arranging with camel-owners for the first
stage of the trip. At Jalo would came the third start, with my own
caravan at my back, and the road to Kufra, already traversed but
still by no means familiar, before me. Then the last setting out of
all, as I rode out of Kufra with my face toward the unknown and the
unexplored.</p>

<p>Abdullahi and Ahmed were already at Sollum, with the heavy
baggage, and the camels were arranged for, the agreement only
awaiting my approval. We proceeded to get our outfit and supplies
in order.</p>

<p>Some description of the two Egyptians who accompanied me
throughout the expedition may be of interest. Abdullahi was a
Nubian from Asswan, heavily built, well set up and strong, with a
pair of small eyes, deeply set, that could mask a malicious sense
of humor with great indifference or dignity. A man of about forty,
he was well educated and knew his Koran well. I met him first in
1914, when he was attached to the Idrissi family in Egypt, and I
took an enormous liking to him because of his deeply rooted sense
of humor and his loyalty. He was honest, too, extremely honest, and
therefore I put him in charge of the commissariat. In Abdullahi’s
kit one could always find anything that was needed from strips of
leather with primitive Bedouin needles for mending shoes to
elaborate contrivances for propping up a broken tent-pole. He was
ready, moreover, with “inaccuracies” to suit every situation,
whether he wanted me to appear to be a wandering Bedouin from
Egypt, or a merchant, or an important government official when we
landed in the midst of officialdom in the Sudan. Abdullahi had one
peculiarity: between sunset and an hour or two later it was
apparently a most difficult task to keep him awake; though he might
be sitting down holding a discussion, he would go on dozing as he
sat. On one occasion we had just finished dinner, and, it being
about the hour, Zerwali, my Bedouin loyal companion, who joined our
caravan at Jalo, as a joke took a lot of <i>zatar</i> (a strong
scent used for flavoring tea) and put it in Abdullahi’s tea. In
between dozes, the latter woke up, tasted his tea, knew what had
happened, said nothing, but simply put back his glass. After a
while, however, Abdullahi turned round and said to Zerwali, “I
believe you are expecting a man to see you; I think I hear him
coming.” As Zerwali got up to look, Abdullahi quietly changed round
the glasses, so that Zerwali drank the highly “flavored” tea while
Abdullahi dozed off peacefully once more.</p>

<p>THE TOMB OF THE FOUNDER OF THE SENUSSI</p>

<p class="justify">The tomb, which is covered with an embroidered
green silk cloth, is inclosed in a heavy brass cage. From the
ceiling of the great tomb hang many crystal candelabra, the gifts
of the sultans of Turkey and the khedives of Egypt. The floor is
strewn with very valuable Persian rugs.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Abdullahi’s business instinct came out at its best when we
arrived at inhabited country toward the end of the journey and were
short of food. He collected all the odds and ends of the caravan,
including empty tins and bottles of medicine, even the few used
Gillette blades, and bartered them with the natives for butter,
milk, spices, and leather.</p>

<p>It was Abdullahi also who was greatly upset when I showed my
film of the expedition at a lecture given before H. M. King Fouad
at the Royal Opera House in Cairo. When Abdullahi found that he
appeared in many of the pictures with a tattered shirt, he resented
being shown to his king in such an unsuitable garment and asked if
something could not be done so that he should appear in a shirt
that was cleaner and less well worn.</p>

<p>Ahmed too was a Nubian from Asswan, a slight, wiry fellow who
never gave in. He was my valet and cook. Although very well
educated, he became a cook because he liked to live a free life;
had he become a religious man, as his father wished, he would have
been obliged to lead a model life, and that apparently did not
appeal to him. He was always cheerful, and though no one in the
caravan did so much cursing, the Bedouins did not mind him. At a
word that Ahmed said, had it come from any other, there would have
been bloodshed, but the Bedouins got accustomed to him, and there
was only one row. After his cooking was over Ahmed used to sit down
with the Bedouins and scorn their knowledge of religion; he would
prove his superiority by reciting from memory bits of poetry about
religion and the Arabic language and some of the Prophet’s sayings.
Never once did Ahmed fail to make me a glass of tea even in
circumstances of the greatest difficulty. On one occasion after a
whole night’s trek he was suffering badly from a hurt foot, and as
we were pitching camp I told him casually that I did not want any
breakfast or tea until I had slept and ordered him to go to bed at
once. Nevertheless, just as I was getting my shelter ready, Ahmed
arrived with a steaming glass of tea. He cursed all the Bedouins,
but there was no Bedouin in the caravan for whom, if he felt ill,
Ahmed would not do everything in his power to give him relief. He
had learned gradually the use of such medicines as I had, and
frequently when in doubt would bring me a little bottle to ask
whether it was quinine or aspirin.</p>

<p>The requirements for a desert trek are simple, and the list of
what one takes with one is almost stereotyped. For food there are,
first of all, flour, rice, sugar, and tea. All the people of the
desert are very fond of meat, but it naturally cannot be carried.
One must either shoot it by the way or go without. Tea is the drink
in the Libyan Desert, rather than coffee, and for that there are
two reasons. The first is religious; the second is practical. Sayed
Ibn Ali El Senussi, the founder of that interesting brotherhood
that controls the destinies of the country through which I was to
travel, forbade his followers all luxuries. His prohibition
included tobacco and coffee but, for some reason, did not extend to
tea. His followers, therefore, are tea-drinkers, if you can call by
the same name the delicate, aromatic, pale fluid that graces the
tea-tables of Europe and America and the murky, bitter liquid which
sustains the Bedouin on his marches and revives him at the day’s
end. The second reason is that tea is a stimulant to work on, while
coffee is not. Tea is the thing with which to finish off each meal
of the desert day and to refresh the weary traveler at the end of a
hard day’s trek, leaving coffee for the less strenuous life of the
oasis and the home.</p>

<p>After these staples come dates; or perhaps they ought to be put
first. The camels live on dates, as does the whole caravan when
other foods are exhausted or there is no time to halt and cook a
meal. But the dates are not the rich, sweet, sugary things one is
accustomed to for dessert or a picnic delicacy in western lands.
The date which one must use for desert travel has little sugar
about it. Sugar breeds thirst, and where wells are days apart the
water-supply is not to be prodigally spent.</p>

<p>I took some tinned things with me, bully beef, vegetables and
fruits; but tins are heavy, and to carry enough food in tins for a
long trek would demand a score of extra camels or more. There was a
little coffee in our stores, but we seldom drank it. I used most of
it for presents to the friends we made along the way. A few bottles
of malted milk tablets proved useful for emergency lunches when
food ran low. The Bedouins, however, were not keen on them. “They
fill us up,” they said, “without the pleasure of the taste.”</p>

<div>
<p>A DYING CAMEL<br>
This is a great catastrophe, as his load has to be thrown away</p>
</div></div>

<p>That was our commissary list, except for salt and some spices,
especially pepper for the <i>asida</i>, a pudding of boiled flour
and oil, made pepper hot. There was little variety; but variety is
the one thing one has to give up when one’s supplies are to be
carried by animals who must themselves live chiefly on what they
can carry. There were no luxuries, no matter how pleasant they
might have been to relieve the monotony of rice, unleavened bread,
dates, and tea. If one has experience in desert travel and the
wisdom to learn by it, one takes no foods of which there is not
enough to feed every one in the caravan. On the trek in the desert
there is no distinction of rank or class, high or low.</p>

<p>The sole exception to the rule of no luxuries was tobacco. Since
only one of the men who were with me at any time on the trip
smoked, however, this was no real violation of the rule. A stock of
Egyptian cigarettes and tobacco afforded me constant pleasure and
comfort throughout the journey.</p>

<p>Next comes water, the one great and unceasing problem of desert
travel. Men have lived for an unbelievable number of days without
food, whether from necessity or from curiosity. But the man who
could go for four days without water would be a miracle. A desert
is a desert just because it lacks water. The desert traveler must
think first of his drinking supply.</p>

<p>We carried water in two ways. The regular supply was held in
twenty-five <i>girbas</i>, the traditional sheepskin water-carrier
of the desert. Each holds from four to six gallons—and is easily
burst if two camels carrying <i>girbas</i> bump together in the
dark on a rocky road! So the reserve water-supply for emergencies
is carried in <i>fantasses</i>. They are long tin containers,
oblong or oval shaped in cross-section to hang easily along the
camel’s side. We had four <i>fantasses</i> holding four gallons
each and four others holding twelve gallons each. Our full supply,
therefore, was something like two hundred gallons, enough to last
our caravan, when it was finally organized, on the longest trek
from well to well that we were likely to encounter. We carried only
our reserve supply in <i>fantasses</i>, although they were less
liable to injury, because the <i>girbas</i>, when empty, took up so
little space. All twenty-five of them could be carried on one
camel, while only two <i>fantasses</i> went to a camel, full or
empty. We had no camels to spare.</p>

<p>There were also some individual water-bottles, but most of them
were soon discarded because the men hated the nuisance of carrying
them. A few were kept for cooling water later on in the journey
when the weather became hot. The evaporation of the moisture
through the canvas sides of the bottles or bags kept the water
within at a pleasant temperature.</p>

<p>Four tents, two bell-shaped and two rectangular, and numerous
cooking-utensils, of which the chief was a huge brass <i>halla</i>
or bowl for boiling rice, made up the tale of our equipment. For
emergencies there was a medicine-chest, with quinine, iodine,
cotton and bandages, bismuth salicylate for dysentery, morphine
tablets and a hypodermic syringe, anti-scorpion serum—which was to
plunge me into an apparently serious predicament and rescue me from
it—zinc ointment for eczema, indigestion tablets, and Epsom salts.
I had a primitive surgical kit and a few dental instruments and
remedies which a dentist friend had given me. I was equipped to
take care of the simple every-day ills; if anything more serious
befell, I should have to say, “Recovery comes from God.”</p>

<p>For hunting and possible defense I took three rifles, three
automatic pistols, and a shot-gun. By the time of our return the
shot-gun had been given as a present, and the rest of the arsenal
had been increased by six rifles and one pistol. When the rifles
arrived at Sollum in their characteristically shaped boxes, it was
immediately rumored through the town that I was carrying a
machine-gun, for some mysterious purpose which gossip elaborated to
suit itself.</p>

<p>In order to make the report of what I found and saw as vivid and
truthful as possible I took five cameras. Three of them were
Kodaks, which functioned perfectly to the end; one a more elaborate
instrument with a focal-plane shutter, which was ruined by the
penetrating sand; and the last a cinema machine. For all the
cameras I carried Eastman Kodak films, which were packed with
elaborate care, first in air-tight tins, then in tin cases, sawdust
filled, and finally in wooden boxes. These precautions in packing
proved to be none too great, in view of the intense heat of the
first part of the route and the rain and dampness which we
encountered later on in the Sudan. For the cinema camera I took
nine thousand feet of film. Fortune was with me in all the
photographic work. The films were not developed until my return
eight months later to Egypt, but the percentage of failures was
gratifyingly low. For clothing I took the usual Bedouin garb of
white shirts and long drawers, both made of calico, and a woolen
<i>jerd</i>, the voluminous Bedouin wrap; also silk jackets and
waistcoats and cloth drawers like riding-breeches, but reaching to
the ankles; the latter were used only on ceremonious occasions,
such as entering or leaving an oasis; there were naturally a few
changes of each. I did not wish to put on the desert dress until
the end of the first stage of the journey, so I left Sollum in old
khaki coat and riding-breeches, which had already seen their best
days. With yellow Bedouin slippers on my feet, the only possible
wear in desert travel, and a Jaeger woolen night-cap on my head,
for the weather was keenly cold, I must have been an amusing figure
when we made our start.</p>

<p>WOMEN OF THE ZAGHAWA TRIBE<br>
The women do all the work of watering the cattle and sheep, looking
after the home and the men-folk. They work far less as slaves in
North Africa than they do as free women in their own country.</p>
</div></div>

<p>When traveling into unknown lands, especially in the East, it is
important to be able to make presents to those of prominence whom
you meet. I had what seemed to me an enormous supply of silks,
copper bowls, and censers inlaid with silver, bottles of scent,
silk handkerchiefs, silver tea-pots and tea-glasses, silver
call-bells—which the Bedouin is delighted to be able to use for
summoning his slaves instead of the usual clapping of the hands.
When I saw all this array being packed, I felt sure that we should
bring half of it back with us. But by the time we had reached
Kufra, I discovered that not only those who were of use to me this
time but every one who had rendered the slightest service on my
previous trip was expectant of reward for services rendered. What
with postponed expectations and the opportunities which the present
trip afforded for making presents, we had none too many of the
goods I have mentioned. In making these gifts, however, I did not
feel that it was so much an endeavor to smooth the way of my
expedition as a courtesy from a Bedouin of the town to his brother
Bedouin of the desert.</p>

<p>Most important of all for the ultimate value of the expedition,
if it was to have any, was the scientific apparatus, which is
detailed in Dr. Ball’s report in the appendix.</p>

<p>The fortnight at Sollum was filled with busy days. Simple as our
equipment was, everything had to be as nearly right as thought and
care could achieve. Things carried on camel-back, put on each
morning and taken off each night and built into barricades against
weather and possible attacks, must be snugly and securely packed.
At the end of a day’s trek, careless or tired camelmen often find
it easier to let boxes and bundles drop without ceremony from the
camels’ sides than to handle them with proper care.</p>

<h2><a id="chap05"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class="sub_chapter">PLOTS AND OMENS</p>

<p>My plans were all made for a trek straight south to Jaghbub
when, two days before the date determined upon for the start, an
incident happened which disquieted me.</p>

<p>I was sitting one evening in my room in the little government
rest-house, busy with the figures of my scientific observations.
There came a knock at the door. I could not imagine who could want
me at that hour, but I went to the door and opened it a little way.
A Bedouin whom I did not know was standing there, muffled Bedouin
fashion in his <i>jerd</i>. I shut the door quickly and demanded,
“Who are you?”</p>

<p>“A friend,” was the answer, which somehow did not convince
me.</p>

<p>“What is your name and your business?” I asked.</p>

<p>“I am a friend, and I have something to tell you which you ought
to know,” explained my visitor through the closed door.</p>

<p>I opened the door and demanded what he had to tell. He came
in.</p>

<p>“You are going by the straight road to Jaghbub?” he half
queried.</p>

<p>I nodded assent.</p>

<p>“Don’t go,” he continued with vigor.</p>

<p>“Why not?” I asked.</p>

<p>“The bey is a rich man,” he said. “He carries with him great
stores of the bounty of God, and the Bedouins are greedy. The rumor
is that you have many boxes of gold.”</p>

<p>I could see that he half believed it, though he was pretending
not to.</p>

<p>“The camelmen have agreed with friends on the road that you
shall be waylaid and robbed. You will lose your money and probably
your life.”</p>

<p>“One can always fight,” I suggested.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” he agreed, “if you had plenty of men of your
own.”</p>

<p>I had n’t, so I proceeded to question him further about his
information. The story seemed straight enough, and when I learned
that my visitor was a relative of a man to whom I had done a good
turn when on the last mission to the Senussis, I felt that it would
be wise to believe him. I thanked him for his warning, and he went
away into the night. I sat down to consider the unpleasantly
melodramatic situation.</p>

<div>
<p>SAYED IDRIS EL SENUSSI</p>
</div></div>

<p>The desert people are quick to ferret out your purpose if they
can, and, if they cannot, to build up imaginary stories to account
for what you are and have and intend to do. Much of our
paraphernalia was in boxes. Boxes, to the Bedouin mind, mean
treasure. If three rifles in a case could be translated into a
machine-gun, why should not cameras and instruments in boxes be
translated into gold and bank-notes? It was no wonder that the men
whose camels we had hired were convinced that I was going into the
desert with vast wealth for some unknown purpose. It was quite
possible that they planned to rob me. It was a cheerful outlook for
the very beginning of our journey. A fight, no matter how
successful, would be a poor start for our undertaking. I decided
that it would be better to avoid this first obstacle in our path
rather than to encounter it.</p>

<p>Promptly the next day the camel-owners whose pleasant little
plan had been revealed to me found themselves discharged. Others
with their camels were forthwith hired to take me to Siwa. Instead
of the straight line to Jaghbub we would go along the two other
sides of the triangle whose apices were Sollum, Siwa, and Jaghbub.
It would materially lengthen this first part of our journey, but,
after all, time and distance were less important than safe arrival.
The road by way of Siwa had several advantages. It lay in Egyptian
territory and not in the country inhabited by the tribes to which
the first set of camelmen belonged. In the second place, it ran
through more frequented territory, where a treacherous waylaying of
our caravan would have been more perilous to the waylayers. Lastly,
our quick departure after the change of plan gave the conspirators
no time to develop any new plot if they had wanted to. It looked
safe, and it proved to be as safe as it looked.</p>

<p>On January 1 the caravan started, and three days later
Lieutenant Bather very kindly took me in a motor-car to catch up
with it. We found the caravan at Dignaish, thirty-six miles out;
and, saying good-by to the lieutenant, I took up the journey.</p>

<p>It was then a six days’ trek to Siwa. Our spare time was
profitably spent in camouflaging the boxes and cases in our luggage
to look like the usual Bedouin impedimenta. The only event of
interest during the six days was the first of three good omens that
foretold success to the trip. On the fifth day in the late
afternoon I saw a gazelle feeding a little distance off our track.
Without other thought than the pleasant anticipation of fresh meat,
I set out after it. As I went I heard discouraging shouts and howls
from the men behind me. I could not understand their reluctance to
have me go after the game, in view of the Bedouin’s love of meat. I
imagined that they were afraid I would be led away some distance
from them and thus hold up the progress of the caravan. The reason
did not seem sufficient, and so I pursued my quest. After some
chase I got a shot at the gazelle and brought it down.</p>

<p>As I approached the caravan with my game, I was surprised again.
The men came running toward me with waving arms and shouts of
joyful congratulation. I understood their present state of mind no
more than I had their former one, until the explanation was
forthcoming.</p>

<p>Then I learned that among the Bedouins the first shot fired at
game after a caravan sets out is the critical one. If it is a miss,
disaster is certain to overtake the caravan before the journey’s
end. If it is a hit, fortune will smile upon the whole undertaking.
The men of the caravan had been reluctant to see me put our luck to
the test so soon. If I had remembered the Bedouin travel lore, I
should have saved my first shot at game until we reached El Fasher,
six months later.</p>

<p>We were three days in Siwa, hiring other camels for the trek to
Jaghbub and making a few final preparations. Siwa was the last
outpost of the world I was leaving behind. There the postal service
and the telegraph end. Beyond that point there is nothing to be
bought except the products of the desert, or occasionally a little
rice or cloth, perhaps at exorbitant prices. In my three days I
enjoyed the hospitality and valuable assistance of the Frontier
Districts Administration, in the persons of the <i>mamur</i> and
town officials and of Lieutenant Lawler, in command of the troops
there.</p>

<p>Siwa is the biggest and most charming of oases; springs of
wonderful water, excellent fruit, the best dates in the world,
picturesque scenery, and the quaintest and most interesting of
customs. For example, if a woman loses her husband she is kept
forty days without washing, and nobody sees her. Her food is passed
through a crack in the door. When the forty days have expired, she
goes to bathe in one of the wells, and everybody tries to avoid
crossing her path, for she is then called <i>ghoula</i> and is
supposed to bring very bad luck to anybody who sees her on that day
of the first bath.</p>

<p>In the date market, called the <i>mistah</i>, all the dates are
piled together, the best quality and the most inferior. No one
thinks of touching one date that does not belong to him or mixing
the dates together with a view to gaining an advantage thereby. On
the other hand, anybody can go into a <i>mistah</i> and eat as much
as he likes from the best quality without paying a <i>millième</i>,
but he must not take any away with him.</p>

founder of the sect. He can quote from memory all the incidents
that took place in his time, giving day and year of every
event.</p>
</div></div>

<p>In Siwa there is a shrine of a saint where people may deposit
their belongings for safety. If a man is going away he can take his
bags with the most valuable things and put them near this shrine,
and nobody would dream of touching them. Literally, if any one left
a bundle of gold there, no one would touch it, because of the very
simple but unshakable belief in them that if you touch anything
near that shrine and it does not belong to you, you would have bad
luck for the rest of your life.</p>

<p>When I was ready to leave Siwa, my little group of personal
retainers had doubled in number. At Sollum I had added to Abdullahi
and Ahmed a man of the Monafa tribe named Hamad. He was the
hardest-working individual in the entire caravan. I never saw him
tired. He took charge of my camel and later of the horse which I
secured at Kufra. The fourth member of the group was Ismail, a
Siwi. He looked like a weakling, but on the trek he was always the
last man to give in and ride a camel. Ismail was the one whom I
used to take with me when prospecting for geological specimens or
making elaborate scientific observations. Coming from an oasis in
Egyptian territory where the post and the telegraph made connection
with the outside world, he had less of the wild Bedouin’s suspicion
that interprets every simple action of the stranger into something
with an ulterior motive. Why should the bey be chipping off bits of
rock, the Bedouin might say to himself, unless there were gold in
it, or he intended to come and conquer the country? Not so Ismail.
If the bey wanted a bit of rock, that was for the bey to say.</p>

<p>We left Siwa on the fourteenth with our new caravan. Our last
link with the outside world was broken. At the first stop I took
off my faded khaki and put on the Bedouin costume and felt myself
now a part of the desert life. The effect upon the men was
immediate. Till now they had approached me with embarrassment and
awkwardness. Now they came up naturally, kissed my hand in Bedouin
fashion, and said, “Now you are one of us.”</p>

<p>Our second good omen befell us a few miles out of Siwa. We found
dates in our path, where some unfortunate date merchant taking his
cargo to market had had an accident. Dates in the way are a promise
of good fortune for the journey. Often, when a Bedouin is setting
out with his caravan, friends will go secretly ahead and drop dates
where he will be sure to pass them. With my first shot and the
gazelle and the dates in the path, we had every reason to be
cheerful. But the best omen of all was to come.</p>

<p>I had sent two men ahead with a letter to Sayed Idris at
Jaghbub, to inform him of my approach. In the desert one does not
rush upon a friend or a dignitary headlong and unannounced. There
should be time for both to put on fresh clothing and go with
dignity to the meeting as becomes gentlemen of breeding.</p>

<p>Two days out from Siwa I was riding some distance behind the
caravan and presently came upon it halted. I asked the reason for
the unusual stop and received the reply, “Messengers have come to
say that Sayed Idris will be here within an hour.” The men could
scarcely conceal their excitement. To be met by the great head of
the Senussis himself at the beginning of our journey was the most
auspicious of omens. The rest of the message was indicative of the
etiquette of the desert. “He asks the bey to camp so that he may
come to him.”</p>

<p>We immediately made camp, and before long the vanguard of Sayed
Idris’s caravan appeared and made camp in their turn a short
distance away. A half-hour later Sayed Idris himself, with his
retinue, advanced toward my camp, and I went to meet him.</p>

<p>Sayed Idris met me with warm cordiality, and we renewed the
acquaintance made on our previous meetings with deep gratification
on my part and apparent pleasure on his. The former trip could
never have been successful without the countenance he gave to it
and the assistance he rendered; how much more the present one,
which was to take me three times as far and into more completely
unknown regions.</p>

<p>In his tent we lunched on rice, stuffed chicken, and sweet
Bedouin cakes, followed by glasses of tea delicately scented with
mint and rose-water. I told him of my plans and gave him news of
the outside world. He was interested to know the final issue of the
Peace Conference at Versailles.</p>

<p>At his suggestion, I brought all the men of my caravan to his
tent to receive his blessing. As I stood with them and heard the
familiar words fall from his lips, there came irresistibly to my
mind that moment in the incense-shrouded room in Cairo and my
father’s blessing upon my undertaking. Then my imagination had
leaped out to meet the vision of the desert, the camels, the
Bedouin life. Now the need for imagination was gone. I was in
Bedouin kit, with the camels of my caravan behind me, and the road
to the goal I sought stretching ahead.</p>

<p>To my men the experience of being blessed by Sayed Idris himself
was the greatest augury of success that we could have had. Nothing
could harm us now.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we said farewell, both camps were broken, and
both caravans took up the march, Sayed Idris going east into Egypt
and I west to Jaghbub and the long trail into the desert. As we
marched my men insisted on following the track made by the caravan
of Sayed Idris, to prolong the great good fortune that had befallen
us.</p>

<h2><a id="chap06"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class="sub_chapter">THE SENUSSIS</p>

<p>Any story of the Libyan Desert would not be complete without
some consideration of the Senussis, the most important influence in
that region. The subject is a complicated one. Justice might be
done to it if an entire volume were available, but within the
limits of a chapter only the important points of Senussi history
can be touched.</p>

<p>The Senussis are not a race nor a country nor a political entity
nor a religion. They have, however, some of the characteristics of
all four. In fact they are almost exclusively Bedouins; they
inhabit, for the most part, the Libyan Desert; they exert a
controlling influence over considerable areas of that region and
are recognized by the governments of surrounding territory as a
real power in the affairs of northeastern Africa; and they are
Moslems. Perhaps the best short description of the Senussis would
be as a religious order whose leadership is hereditary and which
exerts a predominating influence in the lives of the people of the
Libyan Desert.</p>

<p>The history of the brotherhood may be roughly divided into four
periods. In each it took its color from the personality of the
leader. These were respectively Sayed Ibn Ali El Senussi, the
founder; Sayed El Mahdi, his son; Sayed Ahmed, the nephew of the
latter; and Sayed Idris, the son of El Mahdi, the present head of
the brotherhood.</p>

<p>Sayed Mohammed Ibn Ali El Senussi, known as the Grand Senussi,
was born in Algeria in the year 1202 after the Hegira, which
corresponds to 1787 in the Christian calendar. He was a descendant
of the Prophet Mohammed and had received an unusually scholarly
education in the Kairwan University, in Fez, and at Mecca, where he
became the pupil of the famous theologian Sidi Ahmed Ibn Idris El
Fazi. He developed an inclination to asceticism and a conviction
that what his religion needed was a return to a pure form of Islam
as exemplified in the teachings of the Prophet.</p>

<p>At the age of fifty-one he was compelled to leave Mecca by the
opposition of the older <i>sheikhs</i>, who challenged his
orthodoxy. He returned through Egypt to Cyrenaica and began to
establish centers for teaching his doctrines among the
Bedouins.</p>

<p>At this point an explanation of the meaning of three Arabic
words will elucidate the text. They are <i>zawia</i>,
<i>ikhwan</i>, and <i>wakil</i>.</p>

<p>A <i>zawia</i> is a building of three rooms, its size depending
on the importance of the place in which it is situated. One room is
a school-room in which the Bedouin children are taught by the
<i>ikhwan</i>; the second serves as the guest-house in which
travelers receive the usual three days’ hospitality of Bedouin
custom; in the third the <i>ikhwan</i> lives. The <i>zawia</i> is
generally built near a well where travelers naturally stop.
Attached to the <i>zawia</i> is often a bit of land which is
cultivated by the <i>ikhwan</i>. The <i>ikhwan</i> are the active
members of the brotherhood, who teach its principles and precepts.
<i>Ikhwan</i> in Arabic is really a plural form, which means
“brothers.” But the singular of the word is never used,
<i>ikhwan</i> having come to be used for one or more. A
<i>wakil</i> is the personal representative or deputy of the head
of the Senussis.</p>

<p>The Grand Senussi found the Moslems of Cyrenaica fallen into
heresies and in danger of rapid degeneration, not only from a
religious but from a moral point of view. Some small examples may
serve to illustrate this point.</p>

<p>At Jebel Akhdar, in the north of Cyrenaica, certain influential
Bedouin chiefs had established a sort of Kaaba, an imitation of the
true one at Mecca to which every believer who could possibly do so
should make his pilgrimage. These founders of a false Kaaba tried
to establish the theory that a pilgrimage thither was a worthy
substitute for the <i>haj</i>, the authentic pilgrimage to the
central shrine of Islam.</p>

<p>The keeping of the month of Ramadan as a time of abstinence and
religious contemplation is an important tenet of the Moslem faith.
The Bedouins used to go before the beginning of Ramadan to a
certain valley called Wadi Zaza, noted for the multiple echo given
back by its walls. In chorus they would shout a question, “Wadi
Zaza, Wadi Zaza, shall we keep Ramadan or no?” The echo of course
threw back the last word of the question, “No—no—no!” Those who had
appealed thus to the oracle would then go home justified in their
own minds in their desire to forego the keeping of the fast.</p>

<p>There were also prevalent among the Bedouins remnants of old
barbaric customs—such as the killing of female children “to save
them from the evils which life might bring”—which stood between
them and their development into worthy exponents of Islam.</p>

<p>In such circumstances what the founder of the Senussi
brotherhood had to give, in his teaching and preaching of a return
to the pure tenets of Islam, met a poignant need.</p>

<p>Sayed Ibn Ali El Senussi founded his first <i>zawia</i> on
African soil at Siwa, which is in Egypt close to the western
frontier. From that point he moved westward into Cyrenaica,
establishing <i>zawias</i> at Jalo and Aujila. He traveled westward
through Tripoli and Tunis, gradually spreading his teachings among
the Bedouins. His reputation as a saintly man and a scholar had
preceded him, and he was much sought after by the Bedouin chiefs,
who vied with one another to give him hospitality.</p>

<p>On his return to Cyrenaica in the year 1843 he established at
Jebel Akhdar near Derna a large <i>zawia</i> called El Zawia El
Beda, the White Zawia. Until this time he had no headquarters but
led the life of a wandering teacher. He settled down at El Zawia El
Beda and received visits from the leading Bedouin dignitaries of
Cyrenaica.</p>

<p>The Grand Senussi preached a pure form of Islam and strict
adherence to the laws of God and his Prophet Mohammed.</p>

<p>His teachings may perhaps be best illustrated by a passage from
a letter to the people of Wajanga, in Wadai, the original of which
I saw at Kufra and translated. The passage reads as follows:</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>We wish to ask you in the name of Islam to obey God and His
Prophet. In his dear Book he says, praise be to him, “O ye, who are
believers, obey God and obey the Prophet!” He also says, “He who
obeys the Prophet has also obeyed God.” He also says, “He who obeys
God and His Prophet has won a great victory.” He also says, “Those
who obey God and the Prophet, they are with the prophets whom God
has rewarded.”</p>

<p>We wish to ask you to obey what God and His Prophet have
ordered; making the five prayers every day, keeping the month of
Ramadan, giving tithes, making the <i>haj</i> to the sacred home of
God [the pilgrimage to Mecca], and avoiding what God has
forbidden—telling lies, slandering people behind their backs,
taking unlawfully other people’s money, drinking wine, killing men
unlawfully, bearing false witness, and the other crimes before
God.</p>

<p>In following these you will gain everlasting good and endless
benefits which can never be taken from you.</p>
</div>

<p>The principal concern of the founder of the Senussis was with
the religious aspect of life. He did not set out to be a political
leader or to grasp temporal power. He counseled austerity of life
with the same enthusiasm with which he practised it. He taught no
special theological doctrines and demanded acceptance of no
particular dogmas. He cared much more for what his followers did
than for any technicalities of belief. His only addition to the
Moslem ritual was a single prayer, which he wrote and which the
Senussis use, called the <i>hezb</i>. It is not opposed to anything
taught by the older theologians, nor does it add anything to what
is found in the Koran. It is simply expressed in different
language. In the letter to the people of Wajanga, which I have
quoted, another passage described his mission, which God had laid
upon him, as that of “reminding the negligent, teaching the
ignorant, and guiding him who has gone astray.”</p>

<p>He forbade all kinds of luxurious living to those who allied
themselves with his brotherhood. The possession of gold and jewels
was prohibited—except for the adornment of women—and the use of
tobacco and coffee. He imposed no ritual and only demanded a return
to the simplest form of Islam as it was found in the teaching of
the Prophet. He was intolerant of any intercourse, not only with
Christians and Jews, but with that part of the Moslem world which,
in his conviction, had digressed from the original meaning of
Islam.</p>

<p>In the year 1856 Sayed Ibn Ali founded at Jaghbub the
<i>zawia</i> which eventually developed into the center of
education and learning of the Senussi brotherhood. His choice of
Jaghbub was not haphazard or accidental but a demonstration of his
wisdom and practical sagacity. He conceived it to be of the first
importance to reconcile the different tribes of the desert to each
other and to bring peace among them. One more quotation from his
letter illustrates this point:</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>We intend to make peace between you and the Arabs [the people of
Wajanga to whom this letter is addressed are of the black race] who
invade your territory and take your sons as slaves and your money.
In so doing we shall be carrying out the injunction of God, who has
said, “If two parties of believers come into conflict, make peace
between them.” Also we shall be following his direction, “Fear God,
make peace among those about you, and obey God and his Prophet if
you are believers.”</p>

<p>SIWA</p>

<p class="justify">One of the most historic oases of northern
Africa. It was noted for its temple of Amon even before the time of
Herodotus, and Alexander the Great came here to consult the oracle.
In the middle distance, slightly to the right, is the covered
market-place. Lofty structures indicate that Siwa was at one time a
point of defense from desert tribes.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Jaghbub was a strategic point for his purpose. It stood midway
between tribes on the east and on the west who had been in
constantly recurring conflict. With his headquarters there the
Grand Senussi could bring his influence to bear on the warring
rivals and carry out the command of the Prophet to “make peace
among those about you.” From a practical standpoint Jaghbub was an
unpromising place in which to set up such a center of educational
and religious activity as the Grand Senussi had in contemplation.
It is not much of an oasis, if indeed it can be called an oasis at
all. Date-trees are scarce there, the water is brackish, and the
soil very difficult to cultivate. Its strategic importance,
however, was clear, and without hesitation he selected it as the
site of his headquarters. The raids made upon each other by the
tribes to the east and the west were brought to an end through his
influence. He settled many old feuds not only between those tribes
but among the other tribes in Cyrenaica.</p>

<p>Sayed Ibn Ali lived for six years after establishing himself at
Jaghbub and extended his influence far and wide. The Zwaya tribe,
who had been known as the brigands of Cyrenaica, “fearing neither
God nor man,” invited him to come to Kufra, the chief community of
their people, and establish a <i>zawia</i> there. They agreed to
give up raiding and thieving and attacking other tribes and offered
him one third of all their property in Kufra if he would come to
them. He could not go in person but sent a famous <i>ikhwan</i>,
Sidi Omar Bu Hawa, who established the first Senussi <i>zawia</i>
at Jof in Kufra, and began the dissemination of the teachings of
the Grand Senussi among the Zwayas. Sayed Ibn Ali also commissioned
<i>ikhwan</i> to go into many other parts of the Libyan Desert, and
before his death all the Bedouins on the western frontier of Egypt
and all over Cyrenaica had become his disciples.</p>

<p>He died in the year 1859, and was buried in the tomb over which
rises the <i>kubba</i> of Jaghbub.</p>

<p>The Grand Senussi was succeeded by his son Sidi Mohammed El
Mahdi, who was sixteen years old when his father died. In spite of
his youth his succession as head of the order was strengthened by
two circumstances. It was remembered that on one occasion, at the
end of an interview with his father, El Mahdi was about to leave
the room, when the Grand Senussi rose and performed for him the
menial service of arranging his slippers, which had been taken off
on entering. The founder of the order then addressed those present
in these words: “Witness, O ye men here present, how Ibn Ali El
Senussi arranges the slippers of his son, El Mahdi.” It was
realized that he meant to indicate that the son not only would
succeed the father but would surpass him in holiness and
sanctity.</p>

<p>Then too there was an ancient prophecy that the Mahdi who would
reconquer the world for Islam would attain his majority on the
first day of Moharram in the year 1300 after the Hegira, having
been born of parents named Mohammed and Fatma and having spent
several years in seclusion. Each part of this prophecy was
fulfilled in the person of El Mahdi. The choice as successor to the
Grand Senussi fell upon him.</p>

<p>When Sayed El Mahdi reached his majority there were thirty-eight
<i>zawias</i> in Cyrenaica and eighteen in Tripolitania. Others
were scattered over other parts of North Africa; and there were
nearly a score in Egypt. It has been estimated that between a
million and a half and three million people owed spiritual
allegiance to the head of the brotherhood when El Mahdi became its
active head. He was the most illustrious of the Senussi family.</p>

<p>He saw from the first that there was more scope for the
influence of the brotherhood in the direction of Kufra and the
regions to the southward than in the north. In the year 1894 he
removed his headquarters from Jaghbub to Kufra. Before his
departure he freed all his slaves, and some of them and their
children are still to be found living at Jaghbub.</p>

<p>His going to Kufra marked the beginning of an important era in
the history of the Senussis and also in the development of trade
between the Sudan and the Mediterranean coast by way of Kufra. The
difficult and waterless trek between Buttafal Well near Jalo and
Zieghen Well just north of Kufra became in El Mahdi’s time a beaten
route continually frequented by trade caravans and by travelers
going to visit the center of the Senussi brotherhood. “A man could
walk for half a day from one end of the caravan to the other,” a
Bedouin told me.</p>

<p>The route from Kufra south to Wadai was also a hard and
dangerous journey in those days, and El Mahdi caused the two wells
of Bishra and Sara to be dug on the road from Kufra to Tekro.</p>

<p>Under the rule of the Zwaya tribe of Bedouins, who had conquered
Kufra from the black Tebus, that group of oases was the chief
center of brigandage in the Libyan Desert. The Zwayas are a warlike
tribe, and in the days before the coming of the Senussis they were
a law unto themselves and a menace to all those who passed through
their territory. Each caravan going through Kufra north or south
was either pillaged or, if lucky, was compelled to pay a route tax
to the Zwayas. These masters of Kufra were induced by El Mahdi to
give up this exacting of tribute. He realized the importance of
developing the trade of the oases and of the routes across the
Libyan Desert from the north to the south. He strove to make desert
travel safe, and in his day, Bu Matari, a Zwaya chieftain, told me
at Kufra, a woman might travel from Barka (Cyrenaica) to Wadai
unmolested.</p>

<p>El Mahdi also extended the circle of influence of the Senussis
in many directions. <i>Ikhwan</i> were sent out to establish
<i>zawias</i> from Morocco as far east as Persia. But his greatest
work was in the desert, among the Bedouins and the black tribes
south of Kufra. He made the Senussis not only a spiritual power in
those regions, and a powerful influence for peace and amity among
the tribes, but a strong mercantile organization under whose
stimulus trade developed and flourished. In the last years of his
life he undertook to extend the influence of the brotherhood to the
southward in person. He had gone to Geru south of Kufra when his
death came suddenly in the year 1900.</p>

<p>The sons of El Mahdi were then minors, and his nephew Sayed
Ahmed was made the head of the brotherhood. He was the guardian of
Sayed Idris, who, as the eldest son of El Mahdi, was his legitimate
successor.</p>

<p>The new head of the Senussis made an abrupt departure from the
policies of his predecessors. He sought to combine temporal and
spiritual power. When the Italians took over Cyrenaica and Tripoli
from the Turks, Sayed Ahmed attempted to unite his spiritual power
as head of the brotherhood with the remnants of temporal and
military power left by the Turks. Then the Great War broke out, and
he allowed himself to be persuaded by Turkish and German emissaries
to attack the western frontier of Egypt. The effort was a complete
failure, and Sayed Ahmed was compelled to go to Constantinople in a
German submarine.</p>

<p>The third of the Senussi leaders saw things differently from the
Grand Senussi and his son. They had realized that a spiritual
leader cannot be beaten on his own ground, whereas if he takes the
field in quest of temporal supremacy it requires only a few
military reverses to destroy his prestige. The power of Sayed Ibn
Ali El Senussi and Sayed El Mahdi lay in themselves and in the
spiritual influence that radiated from them. Sayed Ahmed
surrendered this influence to rely upon arms, ammunition, and
circumstances. When these failed, there was nothing left.</p>

<p>From the hands of Sayed Ahmed the Senussi leadership fell to the
lineal successor, Sayed Idris. He derives a considerable part of
the prestige which he undoubtedly possesses from the fact that he
is the son of El Mahdi. But even without that advantage his own
personal qualities would be an adequate foundation for success in
the important position to which he has been called. He combines
gentleness of disposition with firmness of character to a high
degree. He has the loyal allegiance and support not only of the
Senussi <i>ikhwan</i> but of the people of the Libyan Desert.</p>

<p>In 1917 an agreement was entered into by the Italian Government
with Sayed Idris, as head of the Senussi brotherhood, by which his
right to administer the affairs of the oases of Jalo, Aujila,
Jedabia, and Kufra was expressly recognized. This agreement was
again ratified two years later at Regima. Unfortunately in 1923 a
misunderstanding between the parties to this agreement caused it to
lapse. It is to be hoped, however, that a new arrangement will be
entered into between Sayed Idris and the Italian authorities which
will restore to these oases of the Libyan Desert their peace and
prosperity.</p>

<p>There can be no question that the influence of the Senussi
brotherhood upon the lives of the people of that region is good.
The <i>ikhwan</i> of the Senussis are not only the teachers of the
people, both in the field of religion and of general knowledge, but
judges and intermediaries both between man and man and between
tribe and tribe. The letter to the people of Wajanga already quoted
clearly illustrates how the Grand Senussi laid down this office of
peace-making as the duty of the Senussi brothers. It was developed
and made even more important by his great son, El Mahdi.</p>

<p>The importance of these aspects of the Senussi rule in
maintaining the tranquillity and well-being of the people of the
Libyan Desert can scarcely be overestimated.</p>

<h2><a id="chap07"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class="sub_chapter">THE PEACE OF JAGHBUB</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the second day after the meeting with Sayed
Idris we saw the snow-white <i>kubba</i> (dome) of the mosque at
Jaghbub rising before us. In proper Bedouin fashion we camped a
short distance from the town and sent a messenger ahead to announce
our arrival. Two hours later he returned to say that they were
ready to receive us. The caravan went forward, and as it approached
the walls we fired our rifles in the air. We were met at the gate
by Sidi Hussein, the <i>wakil</i>, or representative of Sayed Idris
in the town, accompanied by a group of <i>ikhwan</i>, who are
teachers in the school. The students lined up along the way and
gave a cheer as we went through. The warmth of the welcome aroused
an echo in our hearts.</p>

<p>Entering Jaghbub was to me like coming home. Two years before it
had been close to the finish of our journey; now it stood as a
starting-point, one of several, it is true, but still a
starting-point, on the greater journey that was to come. The first
time at Jaghbub had been marked by the reaction that comes when the
long trek is over. Now I was expectant and excited. Journey’s end
and trek’s beginning are both great moments, but the emotions they
arouse are not the same.</p>

<p>I was impatient to start again. But one month and four days were
to pass before I took the road, for there were no camels waiting
for me. Before leaving Sollum I had sent a man, Sayed Ali El Seati,
by the direct route to Jaghbub to hire camels and have them waiting
when I should arrive over the longer route by way of Siwa. But Ali
had apparently vanished into thin air. He had gone as far as
Jedabia, I learned, without success, for none of the Bedouins on
the way from Sollum would let him have the beasts I wanted. At
Jedabia, too, he had found no camels available. I waited two weeks
with no sign of Ali. Then I discovered that the reason he could get
no camels was because the road from Jaghbub to Jalo was used
exclusively by Bedouins of the Zwaya and Majabra tribes, and no
other Bedouins dared to venture upon it.</p>

<p>Though I was eager to get going again, I could not resist the
charm and peace of the place in which I found myself immured.
Jaghbub is a center of education and religion. There is no trade
there and no cultivation of the soil, except for some small bits of
oases where former slaves, who had been freed by Sayed El Mahdi
when he moved to Kufra, grew vegetables and a few dates. The life
of the town centers about the mosque, which is large enough to hold
five or six hundred persons, and the school, which is the center of
religious education for the Senussis. Near the mosque are a few
houses belonging to the Senussi family and the <i>ikhwan</i>; and
scattered about both within and without the walls are a number of
private houses. Buildings with rooms for some two or three hundred
students are also grouped near the mosque.</p>

<p>Jaghbub had reached the height of its importance when Sayed Ibn
Ali, the Grand Senussi, made it the center of the brotherhood. When
his son, Sayed El Mahdi, succeeded him, the importance of the town
continued for about a dozen years until he transferred the center
of the brotherhood’s activities to Kufra. Then when Sayed Ahmed El
Sherif, as guardian of young Sayed Idris, was in control, Jaghbub
again flourished as the capital. Its importance has fluctuated
through the years with the presence or absence of the heads of the
family within its walls. If Sayed Idris were to make it again the
seat of the Senussi rule, in two months the school and the town
would be overflowing with members of the brotherhood, with
students, and with pious visitors to the shrine of the Grand
Senussi.</p>

<p>But at the time of my visit there were only eighty young
Bedouins—from eight to fifteen years of age—studying under the
<i>ikhwan</i>. If there had been more teachers there would have
been more students. But at the time of our visit the head of the
Senussi family, whom we had met on his way to Egypt, had his
headquarters in Jedabia, far to the westward.</p>

<p>In an inner room of the mosque a beautifully wrought cage of
brass incloses the tomb where lies the body of that great man, who
sought for his people a pure, austere, and rigidly simple form of
Islam, untainted by contact with the outside world. To this shrine
every adherent of the brotherhood who can accomplish the journey
comes to pay homage and to renew his vows. The students of the
school come to Jaghbub with one of two purposes, either to fit
themselves to become <i>ikhwan</i>, the brothers of the fraternity,
or simply to go back to their homes in the oases educated men with
a right to spiritual leadership in their communities.</p>

<p>Except for the annoying problem of getting camels to take my
expedition to Jalo, about 350 kilometers away to the westward, my
life in Jaghbub was one of peaceful reflection and preparation for
the undertaking before me.</p>

<div>
<p>THE COURTYARD OF THE MOSQUE AT JAGHBUB<br>
The mosque was founded eighty years ago by Sayed Ibn Ali El
Senussi, the founder of the Senussi sect, which is followed by all
the Bedouins of Cyrenaica.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The desert demands and induces a quite different attitude of
mind and of spirit from the bustling life of the city. As I
wandered about the little town and out into the oasis around it, or
stood in the cool, shadowed spaces of the mosque, or sat at times
in the tower above it in conversation with learned Bedouins,
watching the night fall over the milk-white <i>kubba</i> and the
brown mass of buildings it dominates, there dropped away from me
all the worries and perplexities and problems that the
sophisticated life of crowded places brings in its train. Day after
day passed, with a morning’s walk, midday prayers in the mosque, a
quiet meal, a little work with my instruments or cameras, afternoon
prayers, another walk, a meal, followed by the distribution to my
men of friendly glasses of tea according to the Bedouin custom,
again prayers, and, after quiet contemplation of the evening sky
with its peaceful stars, retirement to sleep such as the harassed
city dweller does not know.</p>

<p>Among all the <i>ikhwan</i> whom I met and talked with at
Jaghbub, there was one who particularly interested me, for he would
neither sit and talk with me himself nor could I learn from his
brother <i>ikhwan</i> the reason for his strange aloofness. At
length, by chance, I learned the story of Sidi Adam Bu Gmaira.</p>

<p>Sidi Adam is a withered old man with a refined proud face and a
bitter twist to his mouth. Life has not been kind to him in his old
age. On my first visit to Jaghbub I stayed at his empty house for
three days. I had no chance then of a long conversation with him.
This time he came to see me on the evening of my arrival to welcome
me back to Jaghbub. I felt that a tragedy lay behind this old man.
He is one of the Barassa tribe, one of the élite among the
Bedouins, and he is as proud as any of them; yet he does not accept
his fate, and for some time I wondered how it was that he, a
Bedouin, had not learned to do so. All around me at Jaghbub were
types of benevolent humanity. Sidi Adam alone stood out distinct
from his brethren, a tragic picture of beaten pride.</p>

<p>Late one evening, as I was coming back from the mosque after
prayers, I found Mabrouk, an old slave of Sidi El Mahdi’s. “Peace
be on you and the blessing of God,” I greeted him.</p>

<p>“And on you, my master, and God’s mercy and blessing,” he
replied.</p>

<p>I sat down with him, and we began talking about the little patch
of cultivation to which he was attending. “Ei!” he exclaimed; “we
have not much food, but by the blessing of Sidi El Mahdi the little
we have is as great as abundance anywhere else.”</p>

<p>Just then a frail, tall figure in a white robe flitted like a
ghost across the courtyard. It was Adam Bu Gmaira. “There goes Sidi
Adam,” I said, pointing after him. “He was not looking well when he
came to see me to-day. What ails him, I wonder?”</p>

<p>“Nay, it is not his health, my master. It is an unlucky man who
incurs the displeasure of our masters” —meaning the Senussi chiefs.
“The poor man is suffering for his brother’s bad faith.”</p>

<p>It was then that the story of Bu Gmaira was unfolded to me by
Mabrouk.</p>

<p>Sidi Bu Seif Bu Gmaira, Adam’s brother, was at one time the
trusted and all-powerful <i>wakil</i> of Sidi El Mahdi at Jaghbub.
When he was quite a child a wall fell on him and smashed in his
head. The great Sidi El Senussi, founder of the sect, was
fortunately near-by. He took the child’s head and bandaged it
together, saying, “This head will one day be a fountain of
knowledge and enlightenment.” His prophecy came true. Bu Seif’s
father sent the child to Jaghbub when the Grand Senussi settled
there and left him to study at the mosque of Jaghbub. He became the
leading <i>ikhwan</i> and great professor of Jaghbub. He was also a
poet of no small merit. After the death of the Grand Senussi, Sidi
El Mahdi took him up and made him his sole <i>wakil</i> at Jaghbub
when he left for Kufra, intrusting him with all his property and
the management thereof. But God willed that he should become an
example to the other <i>ikhwan</i> of one who betrays the
<i>asyad’s</i> [master’s] trust. He ran with the world and was
seduced by her. He squandered much of Sidi El Mahdi’s property and
sold many of his slaves, putting the money in his own pocket. It
was decreed that he should be punished. He wrote a letter to a big
governor in Egypt telling him that Sidi El Mahdi was away at Kufra,
that there was no one at Jaghbub to defend it, and that it was an
opportune moment to occupy the place. (Why he did this is
inconceivable as nobody ever had any desire to occupy Jaghbub, but
doubtless Bu Seif thought he might get something out of it.)</p>

<p>At that time Sidi Mohammed El Abid El Senussi, a nephew of El
Mahdi, was staying at Jaghbub. He heard that Bu Seif had written a
letter and was sending it to Egypt and that he had arranged for a
messenger to take it across the frontier after nightfall. El Abid
at once despatched two <i>ikhwan</i> to waylay the messenger and
bring him back the letter. Two days later the messenger was
brought. El Abid saw the letter but said nothing to Bu Seif. He
simply ordered a caravan to be prepared for Kufra and asked Bu Seif
to accompany him. The latter tried to excuse himself on account of
old age and health, but El Abid insisted. He had no alternative but
to go. So they set out on the silent journey across the desert, and
on arrival at Kufra the letter was shown by El Abid to Sidi El
Mahdi.</p>

<p>THE DOME OF THE MOSQUE AT JAGHBUB</p>
</div></div>
</div>

<div>
<p class="center spaced-below" style="font-size: smaller;">The mosque is built
on the same lines as the dome at Medina. It is always kept clean
and whitewashed and forms a distant landmark for all those
approaching Jaghbub.</p>
</div>

<p>On the Friday following their arrival after the midday prayers
at the mosque of Taj in Kufra, Sidi El Mahdi called together all
the <i>ikhwan</i>, including Bu Seif. “Sidi Bu Seif, thou knowest
what thou hast done.” There was a hush. Everybody in the mosque
tingled with excitement, knowing there was something to come. “But
we shall not punish thee. Thou shalt live; thou shalt draw thy pay
and thy rations according to custom. God alone will punish those
who have betrayed our trust. But thou shalt read aloud to this
gathering of <i>ikhwan</i> the letter which thou hast written with
thine own hand.”</p>

<p>Bu Seif had no alternative but to read the letter. The
<i>ikhwan</i> were silent, though there was much surprise, for this
was thought to be the most trusted man of Sayed El Mahdi.</p>

<p>“Henceforward thou shalt be relieved of the trouble of looking
after our affairs,” said Sidi El Mahdi, dismissing him. Bu Seif was
then led to his house a sick man. He died a few days later. His two
sons died in the following few months. His remaining two daughters
were taken in marriage by members of the Senussi family. All his
books—and it is said he possessed the best library in the Senussi
circle—and his property were taken by the Senussi family. The only
remaining man of his family is Adam, his brother, who had inherited
the empty house at Jaghbub and the stigma attaching thereto. With
the death of Adam the family will be extinct.</p>

<h2><a id="chap08"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class="sub_chapter">MEALS AND MEDICINE</p>

<p>At intervals there were pleasant marks of hospitality from the
Senussi leaders at Jaghbub. There are various forms of hospitality
among the Bedouins, depending upon the rank both of the host and of
the guest and upon the circumstances of the given case. When a
traveler comes to an oasis or a town in the desert he has with him
his own caravan, provided with all the necessities of living. He
does not put up at a hotel or go to a friend’s house to live but
sets up his own establishment, either pitching his tents and making
a camp, or perhaps, as happened to me at Jaghbub, at Jalo, and
again at Kufra, occupying a house put at his disposal by some one
in the place. Then comes the question of entertainment and honor
from the dignitaries of the community. They may either invite one
to luncheon or to dinner in their own houses or send a meal to the
guest at his own house or camp. The first form of hospitality I
shall describe when we reach Jalo, where I was entertained by
twelve or fifteen notables in turn. The second form was that which
I received at Jaghbub. This variety of hospitality may be extended
from three to seven days, depending upon the respective ranks of
host and guest.</p>

<p>Several days after my arrival Sidi Ibrahim and Sidi Mohi Eddin,
young sons of Sayed Ahmed, the former guardian of Sayed Idris, who
is now in Angora, boys of thirteen and fifteen years of age, made
the <i>beau geste</i> of showing me hospitality. There arrived at
my house a Bedouin of the Barassa tribe, with two slaves laden with
food. They set before me a feast of at least a score of dishes, and
I was bidden to eat. The representative of my hosts sat courteously
by, himself not touching a morsel, while I tasted the dishes in
turn; no mortal man could eat them all and live. It was his
function as deputy host to see that I lacked nothing to make the
meal a satisfying and pleasant one, and to entertain me with
conversation while I ate. The men of his tribe are the aristocrats
of the desert, tall, erect, handsome, proud and with the spirit and
courage of lions. A Barassy, if he were alone in the midst of an
alien tribe, would not hesitate to meet an insult or a discourtesy
with instant challenge and to fight the whole lot single-handed if
it came to that.</p>

<p>Under his solicitously attentive eye, and waited on by the
slaves who accompanied him, I ate my meal. I am not sure that I can
remember the full tale of the dishes that were set before me, but
they ran something like this: a rich meat soup, made with butter
and rice; a great dish of boiled meat; a big bowl of rice with bits
of meat in it; eggs, hard-boiled, fried, and made into an omelet
with onions and herbs; tripe; meat in tomato sauce; meat
croquettes; sausages; vegetable marrows; <i>bamia</i> or okra;
<i>mulukhia</i>, an Egyptian vegetable with a peculiar flavor of
its own; marrows stuffed with rice and bits of meat;
<i>kus-kus</i>, a distinctively Arab dish made of flour and
steamed; a salad; a kind of blanc-mange or pudding of corn-flour
and milk; Bedouin pancakes with honey; a sweet pudding of rice; a
delicate kind of pastry made of flour with raisins and almonds.
This last is an Egyptian dish rather than one native to the desert.
The slave who had cooked my meal, knowing me to be an Egyptian, had
put forth her best energies to please me and as a climax had
provided this Egyptian delicacy. At home we call it
<i>sadd-el-hanak</i>, “that which fills the mouth.” It fills the
soul of the epicure with joy as well.</p>

<div>
<p>THE EXPLORER’S CARAVAN CAUGHT IN A SAND-STORM</p>
</div></div>

<p>In the Bedouin cuisine meat predominates, generally lamb or
mutton. True hospitality without meat is impossible for the
desert-dweller to imagine. It is the key-stone of the structure not
only of Bedouin hospitality but of Bedouin living, except of course
when one is on the trek and cannot get it. A guest must be given
meat, and it must be meat specially provided for him. When a
Bedouin invites one to dine with him, he slaughters a sheep
expressly for his visitor. As a rule he will neither prepare the
meal nor even kill the animal until one has arrived, in order that
there may be no doubt that the preparations were made expressly for
the guest. He carries his courtesy to the point of asking a guest,
on his arrival to partake of a meal, to lend him a knife with which
to slaughter a sheep, for hospitality demands that the guest shall
be convinced that full honor is being done him.</p>

<p>The great variety of dishes on the Bedouin menu, when a friend
or a stranger is being formally entertained, is the essence of the
ceremony. The greater the number the better the host and the higher
the honor he is able to pay the partaker of the meal.</p>

<p>Bedouin entertaining concentrates itself upon food, for in the
desert there is nothing to be had in the way of pleasure except
eating. In the primitive surroundings of an oasis, to eat is the
whole story.</p>

<p>Two incidents of that month in Jaghbub interested me as
illustrating how, with all their differences, the East and the West
are often humorously alike. The one incident was comic, but the
other had pathos in it as well as humor.</p>

<p>I had given instructions that no one who came to my house in
quest of medicine should ever be turned away. Sidi Zwela, an
<i>ikhwan</i>, had appealed for help for his cough, and I had given
him a bottle of cough-syrup. Two days later he appeared again. He
said the first few doses had done him so much good that he had
quickly finished the bottle. Might he have another bottle?
Abdullahi, who was present at the interview, after his departure
growled out a cynical comment: “Yes, he found it sweet and pleasant
to the taste. He takes it as a delicacy and not as a medicine.” The
comment was probably accurate. More than one child I had heard of
during my years in England whose cough persisted strangely so long
as the cough-medicine was sweet and tasty.</p>

<p>I am afraid that my men used to boast about the things that
could be done with what we had among our stores. The Baskari, after
Ahmed had been pulling his leg about my having medicine for
everything, came to me to ask for something to cure a slave-girl of
absent-mindedness. I could only reply that from my experience in
various lands to keep a servant from forgetting was as easy as to
prevent water from sinking into the sand.</p>

<p>The second incident involved two men as different as day and
night. There came to my house one day a slave of the <i>wakil</i>
sent by his master to consult me. It was a matter about which Sidi
Hussein could not approach me in person. Bedouin etiquette forbids
a man to talk to another about his wife, or even about any
particular woman who is not known to both of them. But a slave
could say for him what his dignity forbade him to speak in person.
The slave’s message was that the wife of the <i>wakil</i> had borne
no children, which was a keen disappointment to the husband.
Surely, his master thought, I must have, in my medicine-chest
filled with the wonders of the science of the West, some remedy for
the poor woman’s childless state.</p>

<p>My thoughts went straight back to my last days at Oxford. An old
college servant was an excellent fellow, but most inordinately shy.
He came to me one day as I was preparing for the journey home, and
with a tremendous summoning of his courage proffered a request.</p>

<p>“If you would allow me, sir,” he said, “to ask a favor? My wife
and I have no children. The doctor can’t help us; he has nothing to
suggest. Now, sir, back in that country of yours, I’ve heard it
said, they have wonderful talismans that will do all kinds of
things. I’m not one who has believed much in having to do with
magic, but this is a very special case. Do you think you might find
me a talisman and send it on? If it’s not asking too much,
sir?”</p>

<div>
<p>DESERT SANDS COVERING DATE-TREES<br>
In a few years if the wind continues in the same direction the
trees will be embedded forever in the sands</p>
</div></div>

<p>In the face of his anxiety and the courageous breaking down of
the barriers of his shyness, I could only answer gravely but
sympathetically that I would do what I could. But the necessity did
not arise. He had died, remembered by Balliol men past and present,
before I came to Oxford again.</p>

<p>In the case of Sidi Hussein, however, I could not put the matter
off. The slave was waiting for an answer, and doubtless his master
was waiting for him. I thought quickly. I gave the slave half a
bottle of Horlick’s malted milk tablets, with solemn instructions
that three were to be taken by the lady each day until all were
gone.</p>

<p>When the slave had left, I reflected on the amusing parallel
between the two cases. There in Oxford, the West, having exhausted
all that its science had to offer on behalf of the universal desire
for offspring, had tried to draw upon the spiritual resources of
the East. Here in Jaghbub, the East, finding all its spiritual
appeals of no avail, had turned to the science of the West for aid.
East or West, we alike believe in the miraculous power of the
unknown.</p>

<p>But all this pleasant peaceful life and courteous hospitality
did not produce camels. I sent messengers out into the surrounding
country in quest of the beasts, making my offers of money for their
hire larger and larger as time went on, but I could get no
favorable responses. I invoked the aid of Sidi Hussein, but he
professed himself powerless. I sent a messenger back to Siwa with a
telegram to Sayed Idris in Egypt, informing him of my predicament
and asking his aid. As soon as could be expected, a reply came
directing Sidi Hussein to give me all the assistance in his power.
Still the <i>wakil</i> seemed to be unable to help me.</p>

<p>At last, when things began to seem hopeless, a Zwaya caravan
arrived from Jalo on its way to Siwa for dates. I wanted those
camels, but of course their owners had no desire to turn back
without the dates they had come for. However, a way was found to
persuade them, for I communicated to them, through Sidi Hussein,
the news that an order had been issued by the Egyptian Government
forbidding Zwayas to enter Egyptian territory until they had
composed their differences with the Awlad Ali, who live in Egypt,
and with whom they had a feud. Since they could not go to Siwa,
which is in Egypt, without fear of punishment, there they were
stranded at Jaghbub, with nothing to do but go back the way they
came. That was precisely the way I wanted them to go. The combined
effect of the order of the Egyptian Government, of the message from
Sayed Idris, of the persuasions of Sidi Hussein, and of the promise
of exorbitant prices for hire of their camels, which they succeeded
in dragging out of me because of my necessity, finally made them
agree to take me to Jalo.</p>

<p>The quiet days of contemplation under the shadows of the white
<i>kubba</i> and the anxious days of striving for the means of
continuing my journey came at last to an end. On February 22,
thirty-four days after I had entered Jaghbub, I turned my face to
the westward and set out for Jalo.</p>

<h2><a id="chap09"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class="sub_chapter">SAND-STORMS AND THE ROAD TO JALO</p>

<p>I left Jaghbub in accordance with the best tradition. It was a
day of sand-storm. The Bedouins say that to start a journey in a
sand-storm is good luck. I am not sure, though, that they are not
making a virtue of necessity. It is as though an Italian were to
say that it is good luck to set out when the sun is shining or a
Scotsman when it is raining! Sand-storms are a commonplace in the
desert, but as an experience there is nothing commonplace about
them.</p>

<p>The day dawns with a clear sky and no hint of storm or wind. The
desert smiles upon our setting out, and the caravan moves forward
cheerfully. Before long a refreshing breeze comes up from nowhere
and goes whispering over the sands. Almost imperceptibly it
strengthens, but still there is nothing unpleasant in its blowing.
Then one looks down at one’s feet, and the surface of the desert is
curiously changed. It is as though the surface were underlaid with
steam-pipes with thousands of orifices through which tiny jets of
steam are puffing out. The sand leaps in little spurts and whirls.
Inch by inch the disturbance rises as the wind increases its force.
It seems as though the whole surface of the desert were rising in
obedience to some up-thrusting force beneath. Larger pebbles strike
against the shins, the knees, the thighs. The spray of dancing
sand-grains climbs the body till it strikes the face and goes over
the head. The sky is shut out; all but the nearest camels fade from
view; the universe is filled with hurtling, pelting, stinging,
biting legions of torment. Well for the traveler then if the wind
is blowing at his back! The torture of the driving sand against his
face is bitter. He can scarcely keep his eyes open, and yet he dare
not let them close, for one thing worse than the stinging of the
sand-grains is to lose one’s way.</p>

<div class="figcenter iw2">
<a id="illus17"></a>

<div>
<p>THE ZIEGHEN WELL</p>

<p class="justify">The first well reached in nine days’ trekking
from Jalo on the way to Kufra. The well, which is a water-hole, is
only marked by a dim patch of sand, which the caravans scrape as
they go along. Water is found at four or five feet deep. The fact
that this well is so indistinctly marked makes it easy to miss it
entirely unless the guide is a very good one.</p>
</div></div>

<div>
<p>A HALT IN THE DESERT<br>

ground to grass.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Fortunately the wind comes in driving gusts, spaced in groups of
three or four, with a few seconds of blessed lull after each group.
While the gusts are making their assault, one turns one’s face
away, pulls one side of one’s <i>kufia</i> forward like a screen,
and almost holds one’s breath. When the lull comes, one puts the
<i>kufia</i> back, takes a quick look about to see that one has
kept one’s bearings, then swiftly prepares for the next attack.</p>

<p>It is as though some great monster of fabled size and unearthly
power were puffing out these hurtling blasts of sand upon the
traveler’s head. The sound is that of a giant hand drawing rough
fingers in regular rhythm across tightly stretched silk.</p>

<p>When the sand-storm comes there is nothing to do but to push
doggedly on. Around any stationary object, whether it might be a
post, a camel, or a man, the eager sands swiftly gather, piling up
and up until there remains only a smoothly rounded heap. If it is
torture to go on, it is death itself to halt.</p>

<p>A sand-storm is likely to be at its worst for five or six hours.
While it persists, a caravan can only keep going, with careful
vigilance that the direction be not missed. When the storm is at
its fiercest, the camels will be scarcely moving, but their
instinct tells them that it is death to halt. How instinctively
wise they are is shown by the fact that when it begins to rain they
sense no such danger and will immediately stand still and even lie
down.</p>

<p>The storm drives the sand into everything one possesses. It
fills clothes, food, baggage, instruments, everything. It searches
out every weak spot in one’s armor. One feels it, breathes it, eats
it, drinks it—and hates it. The finest particles even penetrate the
pores of the skin, setting up a distressing irritation.</p>

<p>There are certain rules about the behavior of sand-storms which
every Bedouin knows and is quite ready to tell the stranger to the
desert. The wind that makes the storm will rise with the day or go
to sleep with the sun. There will be no sand-storm at night when
there is a moon. A sand-storm never joins the afternoon and
evening. These are excellent rules; but on our trek to Jalo every
one of them was broken! We had storms when the moon was shining and
storms when the night was dark. We had storms that began before
dawn and storms that did not pause till long after the sun was set.
We had storms that not only joined afternoon and evening but wiped
out the line of demarcation between them. We had little storms and
great storms, the worst I had yet seen; storms that were short and
storms that were long; storms by day and storms by night. But even
under this interminable bombardment, I did not lose the spell of
the desert’s charm. Sometimes at evening, when we had been battling
doggedly against the flying squadrons of the sand for hours, the
wind would stop dead as if a master had put up a peremptory finger.
Then for an hour or so the fine dust would settle slowly down like
a falling mist. But afterward the moon would rise, and under the
pale magic of its flooding light the desert would put on a new
personality. Had there been a sand-storm? Who could remember? Could
this peaceful expanse of loveliness ever be cruel? Who could
believe it?</p>

<p>The trek to Jalo was therefore not an easy one. The sand-storms
were a constant annoyance and sometimes a menace. The latter part
of the way led through a country of sand-dunes, and the caravan had
to go winding about among them. To keep one’s course straight to
the proper point of the compass in spite of those wrigglings and
twistings takes all one’s skill and attention at the best of times.
When a sand-storm is torturing and blinding the whole caravan, the
task becomes a staggering one. Nevertheless we pushed steadily on,
making on the whole good time of it.</p>

<p>In spite of the viciousness of the attacking sands there were
hours of pleasure on this trek.</p>

<p>Memorable were the genial evenings when we were all gathered
around the fire of <i>hatab</i> for our after-dinner glasses of
tea. Then stories would begin to go around. Old Moghaib, with the
firelight playing on the gray hairs of his shaggy beard, would
begin by telling bits of Zwaya history when his grandfather used to
go to Wadai to fight the black tribes and bring back camels and
slaves. Saleh would follow with a tale of the great profits that
his cousin had made on his last trip to Wadai, when he did not have
to fight anybody but brought back leather, ostrich-feathers, and
ivory to sell in Barka, which is the Arabic name for Cyrenaica.</p>

<div>
<p>THE ARMED MEN OF THE CARAVAN<br>

</div></div>

<p>Then I would turn to Ali and demand a lovesong. He was a poet of
sorts and betrothed to Hussein’s sister. If the girl is anything
like her brother, the boy is not doing badly for himself. Ali would
look to his uncle for permission to comply with my request and find
the old man busy with his rosary and pretending to be oblivious of
the turn that matters had taken. It does not befit the dignity of a
gray-haired Bedouin to sit and hear love-songs from the younger
generation. But his respect for me keeps him from leaving the
gathering.</p>

<p>Finally he mutters in his beard, “Sing to the bey, since he
likes to hear our Bedouin songs.” Ali’s pleasant voice rises on the
evening air, and the beads of old Moghaib’s rosary fall through his
fingers with the deliberate regularity characteristic of a man who
is conscious of nothing but his devotions.</p>

<p>So Ali sings:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“I went singing</div>

<div class="verse indent0">&nbsp;And all men turned to hear
me.</div>

<div class="verse indent0">&nbsp;It is Khadra</div>

<div class="verse indent0">&nbsp;Who draws the song from my
soul.</div>

<div class="verse indent0">&nbsp;Red is her cheek like spilt
blood;</div>

<div class="verse indent0">&nbsp;Slim and round she is like a
reed.</div>

<div class="verse indent0">&nbsp;None so young, none so old</div>

<div class="verse indent0">&nbsp;Not to know her.</div>

<div class="verse indent0">&nbsp;If I meet her in the way,</div>

<div class="verse indent0">&nbsp;I will flaunt her—</div>

<div class="verse indent0">&nbsp;Like a scarf upon my spear.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As his voice dies away, is it my imagination, or are the rosary
beads in Moghaib’s fingers moving a little faster? After a pause
Ali sings again:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“Thou slim narcissus of the gardener’s
pride,</div>

<div class="verse indent0">&nbsp;Thy mouth flows honey</div>

<div class="verse indent0">&nbsp;Over teeth of ivory.</div>

<div class="verse indent0">&nbsp;Thy waist is slender</div>

<div class="verse indent0">&nbsp;Like the lion’s running in the
chase.</div>

<div class="verse indent0">&nbsp;Wilt thou have me?</div>

<div class="verse indent0">&nbsp;Or thinkest thou of another?</div>

<div class="verse indent0">&nbsp;Thy form is rounded like a
whip—</div>

<div class="verse indent0">&nbsp;To lie on thy breast</div>

<div class="verse indent0">&nbsp;Were to be in Paradise.</div>

<div class="verse indent0">&nbsp;Love cannot be hidden,</div>

<div class="verse indent0">&nbsp;But Fate is in the hands of
God.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There is silence in the camp, except for the murmur of the dying
fire and the clicking of the rosary. But the rhythm of the beads is
significantly changed now. Toward the end of Ali’s song Moghaib’s
fingers had stopped dead for a moment and then hurried nervously on
as though to deny that they had halted. The old man had been a
great lover in his time, and the boy’s song had stirred his blood
with memories. Perhaps it was fortunate for others around that fire
that they had no clicking rosary-beads to betray them.</p>

<p>After Bu Salama Well, which is a day’s trek from Jaghbub, we
were going through a region where there were remains of a petrified
forest. At intervals we passed great blocks of stone erect like
guideposts along the way. Ages ago they had been living trees, but
now the forces of nature had transferred them from the vegetable
kingdom to the mineral. A few smaller bits of petrified wood were
scattered about, but most of those were hidden beneath the sand.
The larger tree sections had remained visible because the etiquette
of the desert demands that any one passing such a fallen landmark
shall set it erect again. It is also good form, on a newly traveled
track, to build little piles of stones at intervals as notice to
later comers that here lies the way. Sometimes one comes upon a
tree or a shrub on which hang shreds and patches of clothing, and
there one is under obligation to add a thread or a fragment from
his own outfit. These accumulating tokens confirm the tree as a
landmark to later comers and afford the encouragement of the
thought that others have been this way before. In the dead waste
and monotony of the desert any evidence of the passing of one’s
fellow-man is a cheering incident. The sight of camel-dung, of the
bleached bones of a camel, or even the skeleton of an unfortunate
traveler are welcome to the eye, for at least they show that a
caravan had passed that way.</p>

<p>Shortly after leaving Jaghbub we came upon a different kind of
landmark. It consisted of a row of small sand hillocks like
ant-hills stretching across the track. It is called Alam Bu Zafar,
the Bu Zafar landmark, and it is the sign and symbol of a pleasant
Bedouin custom. On any trek, the new-comers to that particular
route are expected to slaughter a sheep for those in the caravan
who have come that way before. The custom is called Bu Zafar. If
the novices do not awaken promptly to their responsibilities, the
veterans give them a hint. One or two of them dash ahead of the
caravan and build a row of sand-piles across the way. When the
caravan reaches the significant landmark, they call out
suggestively, “Bu Zafar, Bu Zafar.” Invariably the hint is taken, a
sheep is slaughtered, and the ceremonial feast is held.</p>

<p>In our caravan there were several who had not gone over this
route before, including myself. I bought a sheep before leaving
Jaghbub so that we who were new to this route might give Bu Zafar
to the old-timers, The Alam Bu Zafar that we came upon, therefore,
was not of our making, but left by some other caravan.</p>

<p>A BIDIYAT FAMILY</p>
</div></div>

<p>We were fortunate in finding grazing for our camels almost every
day until we reached Jalo. Sometimes, it is true, we had to go out
of our way to reach the patches of green among the sand-dunes, but
we always found them. Three kinds of vegetation grow sparsely and
in infrequent spots in this part of the desert. <i>Belbal</i> is a
grayish green bush, whose foliage is not good eating for the
camels. It grows only in the vicinity of a well. Ordinarily the
camels will not touch it, but if very hungry they will. Then
unceasing vigilance is necessary to save oneself from the annoyance
of having a sick camel on one’s hands.</p>

<p><i>Damran</i> is a similar bush, but with darker foliage and
with brown stems which make good fuel when dried. This is excellent
food for the camels, and they eat it eagerly. The third variety of
vegetation is <i>nisha</i>, which grows in tufts of thin leaves up
to a foot high. This too makes good grazing. It is only in the
winter months, however, when the scanty rains come, that these
plants are available. No Bedouin would think of making a journey
between Jalo and Jaghbub in summer without carrying a supply of
fodder for his camels.</p>

<p>On the tenth day from Jaghbub we reached the well of Hesaila,
the first water after Bu Salama. It was marked by a few trees and
small green bushes, and after we had scooped out the drifted sand
with our hands, the water seemed good. But the after-effects were
not so pleasant.</p>

<p>Two days later we found ourselves on the outskirts of the Oasis
of Jalo. Before we could enter, a messenger came rushing to meet
us. He carried a letter from Sidi Mohammed El Zerwali, the
<i>ikhwan</i>, who had been directed by Sayed Idris to accompany us
to Kufra, asking me to camp outside until they could prepare to
receive us properly. Sayed Idris, before he had left Jalo two
months before, had told them that I was on the way and directed
that I should be shown all possible courtesy. They had expected us
long before this, and when we did not come they decided that I had
changed my plans.</p>

<p>We withdrew a short distance from the town and camped. A few
hours later an impressive group of a score or more of Bedouins came
out and drew themselves up in a long line before the village of
Lobba, one of the two villages that make up Jalo. Dressed in our
cleanest and most ceremonial clothes, and my men provided with
ammunition for the complimentary salute, we went forward. I
approached and shook hands with Sidi Senussi Gader Bouh, the
<i>kaimakam</i> or governor of the district, the members of the
Council of Jalo, and other prominent citizens. The <i>kaimakam</i>
made a speech of welcome, to which I replied. My men fired their
guns in salute, and we passed into the town.</p>

<p>I went to the house which was put at my disposal, and received a
visit of ceremony from the Council of Jalo and from Sidi El Fadeel,
the uncle of Sayed Idris. After dinner with Senussi Gader Bouh, I
spent the evening in discussing plans for the trip with Sidi
Zerwali.</p>

<h2><a id="chap10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class="sub_chapter">AT THE OASIS OF JALO</p>

<p>Jalo is one of the most important oases in Cyrenaica. It lies
about 240 kilometers from the Mediterranean at its nearest point,
beyond Jedabia, and about 600 kilometers from Kufra, which is
directly south. The oasis is not only the largest producer of dates
in all the province, but it is the trade outlet for the products of
Wadai and Darfur which come through Kufra. Everything from the
outside world that goes to Kufra passes through Jalo.</p>

<p>“The desert is a sea,” said El Bishari, a prominent chieftain of
the Majabra tribe, “and Jalo is its port.” It was at the height of
its importance something like thirty years ago when El Mahdi
maintained the Senussi capital at Kufra. In those days caravans of
two or three hundred camels came and went between Jalo and the
south each week, but when I was there the traffic had shrunk to
less than a tenth of that. In summer, however, it is swollen by the
demands of the date harvest.</p>

<div>
<p>HAWARIA, A LANDMARK OF KUFRA<br>
It can be seen for hours before arriving at Kufra, and once it is
sighted the caravan is safe</p>
</div></div>

<p>There are two villages at Jalo, over a mile apart, Erg and
Lobba. Between and around them are scattered the date-palms in
picturesque profusion to the number of nearly a hundred
thousand.</p>

<p>Twelve miles to the west lies Aujila, which is the ancient oasis
mentioned by Herodotus as famous for its dates. In Aujila is the
tomb of Abdullahi El Sahabi, who is reputed to have been a clerk of
the Prophet Mohammed. Whether such is actually the case is somewhat
problematical; but at least the prophet did have a clerk named
Abdullahi El Sahabi, that Abdullahi did come to North Africa, and
the tomb of a man of that name is found at Aujila. Many a tradition
has been based on flimsier evidence. The story is told that the
Grand Senussi found the body of Sahabi buried in a remote spot, and
forthwith saw in a vision the spirit which had once inhabited the
body.</p>

<p>“Dig up my body,” said the ghostly visitor, “put it on a camel,
and go forth. Where the camel halts, there you shall build my
tomb.”</p>

<p>The Grand Senussi obeyed the injunction and journeyed till he
came to Aujila. There the camel stopped dead and refused to go on,
and on the spot the tomb was built.</p>

<p>The founder of the Senussi sect and all the members of the
Senussi family and even their prominent <i>ikhwan</i> are believed
to possess occult powers and second sight. Sayed El Mahdi is
credited with having particularly strong occult powers which the
Bedouins call miracles. One of the <i>ikhwan</i> at Jaghbub told me
the following story about Sayed El Mahdi. An ignorant Bedouin came
to him intending to study under him at Jaghbub. Suddenly the man
realized that it was the sowing season and that he had nobody to
look after the sowing of his land. So he thought it best to go away
till after the crop season and then return to his studies. He went
to say good-by to Sayed El Mahdi. He entered the room, sat down,
and, as is the custom, waited until he was spoken to. Sayed El
Mahdi appeared to ignore him for a few minutes. The man felt sleepy
and just dozed off for a minute or two, awaking to Sayed El Mahdi’s
gentle voice saying, “Now you feel at rest, and you know that
matters have been arranged for you.” In that short time the man had
seen in a dream his brother plowing his land and sowing the barley
crop. “Now you shall be our guest,” continued the Sayed, “and study
and pray that God may guide you to the right path. All will be
provided for, as you have seen, and you will have no reason to
worry. God is merciful, and He looks after us all.” The man
remained at Jaghbub and afterward went home just in time for the
harvest. On his return to Jaghbub he told one of the <i>ikhwan</i>
that not only had his crop been sown as he saw in the dream, but
the place seen and the time of the dream were exactly corroborated
by the facts.</p>

<p>Another incident was told me by the <i>kaimakam</i> of Jalo. He
was traveling with a party from Benghazi to Jaghbub to visit Sayed
El Mahdi. They missed a well and were in dire straits. At night a
man, the least enthusiastic of the pilgrims, turned to him and
said, “Now that you have brought us to visit that wonderful man
Sayed El Mahdi, will you ask him to send us some water, if he be as
saintly as you say he is?” That same night at Jaghbub, Sayed El
Mahdi, so the story goes, ordered two of his slaves to take five
camels loaded with water and food, and going out into the open he
indicated the direction they should take, adding that until they
met a caravan they must not stop by the way. In due course they
came across the caravan in distress and rescued it.</p>

<p>There are some of the old <i>ikhwan</i> still living whom even
members of the Senussi family themselves avoid displeasing because
they fear their occult powers. One of these who lives at Kufra was
the <i>ikhwan</i> of a <i>zawia</i> in Cyrenaica. A Bedouin once
brought some sheep to water at the well, and some of them strayed
into the patch of ground attached to the <i>zawia</i> and ate the
young barley. The <i>ikhwan</i> warned the Bedouin to stop his
sheep from doing this, and the man pretended to pay attention but
was really determined that not only these sheep but the whole flock
should go in and help themselves to the crop. And when the
<i>ikhwan</i> came out again it was to see all the flock feeding on
his barley. “May God curse them,” he cried, “the sheep that eat the
crop of the <i>zawia</i>.” The story goes that not a single sheep
emerged alive from the <i>zawia</i> garden.</p>

<p>Until this day the Bedouins fear the Senussi family not so much
because of any temporal power but on account of the spiritual
powers with which they credit them. A Bedouin cursed by one of the
Senussi family lives the whole time in fear of something awful
about to happen to him. His friends, even his own people, try to
avoid his presence lest the curse upon him should account for a
harm to them also.</p>

<p>There is the famous case of the chief clerk of Sayed El Mahdi
who lies in Kufra now half paralyzed. I went to see him. He was
quite happy and very content in spite of the fact that he could not
move his body. On my second visit he was getting confidential
and—half believing, half disbelieving—asked if I had any medicine
for his malady. I hesitated, for I did not want the man to lose
hope entirely. He saw this and, without even giving me the chance
of answering him, said: “No, it is decreed that it should be thus.
It was my fault. Sayed El Mahdi wanted me to journey north. I could
not disobey him, but I tried to avoid the journey. I went as far as
Hawari and there wrote to him pretending to be ill. The answer came
by a messenger that if I were ill I should certainly be relieved of
the journey. The next day I was struck with paralysis and brought
back to Kufra and have been here ever since. That was twenty-five
years ago.”</p>

<div>
<p>CAMELS CROSSING THE SAND-DUNES</p>
</div></div>

<p>The <i>kaimakam</i> at Jalo told me a story when we were
discussing miracles. He said that on one occasion there was a very
severe sand-storm which nearly covered the whole of the tomb at
Aujila. So they brought the slaves to dig it out again. As it was
being dug out the <i>kaimakam</i> came into the chamber which
contained the shrine and noticed a very strong smell of incense. He
called one of the slaves and asked whether he had burned any
incense. The man denied it, yet till now, upon occasion, a visitor
to the tomb will smell this incense, though it is known that none
has been burned.</p>

<p>Jalo is the headquarters of the Majabra tribe of Bedouins, the
merchant princes of the Libyan Desert. A few Zwayas are also found
there, but the Majabras make up the great majority of the two
thousand inhabitants of the two villages. The Majabras have
wonderful business instinct. The Majbari boasts of his father
having died in the <i>basur</i>—the camel-saddle—as the son of a
soldier might boast that his father died on the field of battle.
When I was in Jalo, the Italian authorities, who were then on
unfriendly terms with Sayed Idris, had prohibited the sending of
goods from Benghazi and the other ports of Cyrenaica into the
interior. Consequently prices of commodities at such inland places
as Jedabia went up with a leap. Majabra merchants, arriving at Jalo
with caravans of goods from Egypt, heard of this abnormal situation
in the north. Without a moment’s hesitation they changed their
plans, trekked north instead of south, and sold their goods to
splendid advantage in Jedabia. Then back they dashed—if the camel’s
pace of less than three miles an hour can be so described—to Egypt
or the south for another caravan-load. Arrived again at Jalo with
their merchandise, they inquired carefully as to comparative
conditions in the markets of Jedabia and Kufra and directed their
further journey accordingly. Considering the remoteness of the
desert places—Jalo five days from Jedabia, Kufra from twelve to
eighteen days from Jalo—and the snail-like speed of a caravan, news
travels across the desert with surprising swiftness. At least it
seems so. I suppose the true explanation is that all things are
relative, and while news moves at the camel’s pace, so does
everything else.</p>

<p>While the Majabras are the great traders of the Libyan Desert,
the Zwayas have also their claims to prominence. The rivalry
between the two tribes is always present under the surface, and
occasionally it flashes forth into the light.</p>

<p>There is some envy of the Zwayas by all the other tribes of
Cyrenaica because the man second in importance to Sayed Idris among
the Senussis is Ali Pasha El Abdia, who is a Zwayi. Abdia is a
splendid soldier, a powerful support to Sayed Idris and a man much
trusted by the Senussi leader.</p>

<p>One evening after dinner at Jalo some expression of this rivalry
was given by Sidi Saleh, who belonged to no tribe in Cyrenaica and
was in fact a <i>sherif</i> or descendant of the Prophet, in an
argument with Moghaib and Zerwali, who were both Zwayas. Moghaib
launched into a little history of the achievements of the Zwayas.
Sidi Saleh listened to the Zwayi’s eulogy of his tribe, shook his
head, and remarked, “Their history may be as glorious as Sidi
Moghaib tells you, but they do not fear God.”</p>

<p>At this Moghaib burst forth: “By God, Sidi Saleh, they may not
fear God, but neither do they fear man. Woe to him who dares molest
their caravan or attack their camp.”</p>

<p>Then he came quickly over to me and continued, “We have the
blessing of El Mahdi upon us, for it was to our headquarters in
Kufra that Sidi El Mahdi came and from which he disappeared.”</p>

<p>The Senussis will never say that El Mahdi died, but always that
he “disappeared” or some equivalent expression. In fact there is a
legend among them that he is not dead but wandering over the earth
until such time as he shall come again to his desert people. To the
Zwayas El Mahdi is the most beloved of the Senussi leaders because
it was he who moved the center of activity of the brotherhood to
Kufra, their headquarters. The <i>kubba</i> of the mosque that he
built is the glory of Kufra.</p>

<p>In my own experience the Zwayas at times showed hostility and
made it clear that, although I was a Moslem, the son of a religious
man, and a confidant of Sayed Idris, they did not want me in Kufra.
Some of them even expressed the hope that they would have seen the
last of me when I left Kufra. In spite of this scarcely veiled
antagonism to me, however, I never expect to find better men for a
desert journey than the Zwayas who formed part of my caravan.
Zerwali in particular, a typical Zwayi Bedouin, was the best of
companions and the most reliable of associates.</p>

<p>The Bedouin of Cyrenaica has in him the blood of the Arabs who
passed through the north of Africa on their way to Spain. Although
he has mixed with other native tribes of North Africa, he still
preserves the old Arab tradition. In the case of murder, among the
Senussis, the Bedouins have their own law. As a rule the Senussi
<i>ikhwan</i> intervenes as a peaceful intermediary. He takes the
murderer and an old member of his tribe and goes to the murdered
man’s camp, pitching camp near-by. The <i>ikhwan</i> then
approaches the family of the murdered man, saying, “He who murdered
your man is here”; and, taking him by the hand, he adds: “This is
he who murdered your son. I hand him over to you that you may do as
you will with him.” Usually the answer is, “May God forgive him,
and may God’s justice and mercy fall upon him.” Thereupon the
<i>ikhwan</i> starts arranging for the blood-money, which is
generally three thousand dollars and a slave, the market value of
the latter being known. The injured party may choose between
accepting the money or having its equivalent in camels, sheep, or
other commodities. The money may be paid in instalments extending
over from one to three years, and the arrangement is generally
carried through. In very rare cases or a deep-rooted feud the
family of the deceased refuse to accept blood-money, which means
that they intend to kill the murderer himself, or else one of his
relations or a leading member of his tribe.</p>

<p>Bedouin boys and girls mix freely; it is only in the higher
families that the women are kept in seclusion. As a rule a boy
knows his sweetheart, and he goes to her camp and sings to her,
generally in verse of his own making. If she likes him, she comes
out and answers his song, not rarely in words of her own
composition also. The boy then goes and asks for the girl from her
people, paying a dowry if an agreement is reached. Then with
ceremonial he goes with his friends and takes the girl home to his
camp amid displays of horsemanship and much firing of guns. Cases
have been known of elopements, which usually end in feuds between
tribes, for the Bedouins look upon the man as having stolen the
girl from them. There is a marriage contract, in many cases drawn
up by the <i>ikhwan</i>, and the marriage takes place according to
the Moslem religion. Marriages take place at a very early age,
according to the development of the girl, who may be thirteen or
fourteen, while the boy is between seventeen and twenty. Bedouins
who can afford it marry more than one wife, but in that case the
first wife remains the mistress of the house and takes precedence
even over the favorite wife in anything that has to do with
household management.</p>

<p>I have heard of many cases of lads going off their heads through
falling in love with a girl they could not marry. A Bedouin boy
once came to me to ask for medicine. He looked very frail. He was
slim, with a rather refined face, and spoke very little. “I have
come to ask you for medicine to give me health,” he said. He shook
his head when I asked what was his ailment and answered, “God knows
best.” There was something queer about the boy, something that
puzzled me, but as usual in these cases a few malted milk tablets
were wrapped up carefully in paper and given to him with strict
orders not to take more than three each day. When the boy had gone,
an elderly man came to my tent. He squatted on the floor. “May God
give you health and make your hand give recovery. My son came to
you just now, and you gave him medicine. I have come to explain his
ailment. He is always weak and afflicted by headaches. When night
falls he shuns everybody and seeks solitude; often he goes out to
spend the night in the open.”</p>

<p>I told the old man that the medicine I had given the boy was the
only one I had that might give some relief. “Recovery comes from
God,” replied the man in a sad voice. “We know his remedy, but it
is decreed that he should not have it. The boy is in love with a
girl whose parents refused to give her to him in marriage.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you make an effort, if you know this is the reason of
your son’s illness, and try to get the girl in marriage for your
son?”</p>

<p>“It is too late, now,” replied the father. “She is already
married. But God knows best. . . . She may be many days’ journey
away from here, but she is suffering from the same ailment.” With
that he rose and left my tent, a resigned, pathetic figure.</p>

<p>At Jalo, as at Jaghbub, there were no camels waiting for me when
I arrived. But the reason was not the same, nor the uncertainty so
disturbing. The hire of the necessary camels had been arranged for,
and Omar Bu Helega, their owner, was ready to start just as soon as
the beasts returned from grazing. No good Bedouin starts out on a
long trek until his camels have been fattened and especially have
had their fill of green fodder. A long stretch like that to Kufra,
with no grazing on the way, means feeding the camels on dried dates
exclusively. Dates, say the camelmen, are hot on the liver.
Therefore, they prepare their animals for the ordeal by a course of
green feeding before they start.</p>

<p>Bu Helega’s camels had been taken to near-by grazing grounds for
this course of preparation, and on the appointed day for their
return they did not appear. The next day I wondered about them, the
second day I was concerned, and the day after worried, lest, when
taken from grazing, the beasts might have run away. However, they
had not done so. They put in their appearance on the fourth day,
and when they came they were in excellent condition.</p>

<p>A TEBU WITH HIS CAMEL</p>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>I hired thirty-five camels, paying a high price for them. I
could have bought the beasts outright for from twelve to eighteen
pounds, while Bu Helega demanded thirteen and a half pounds for
their hire for the two or three months’ journey to Abeshe in Wadai.
But it was better so. If I had owned the camels myself the
responsibility for their welfare would have been all mine. It would
have been my men who had them in charge, with no motive beyond the
general one of loyalty to the leader and the job for carrying the
camels through in good condition. But when Bu Helega’s men went
along with his own animals they were sure to have the best of care.
During the trek to Kufra he kept his eye expertly on each one of
them. If a camel weakened or seemed ill, he shifted loads to meet
the emergency. He did everything to keep them fit to the journey’s
end, and his care of them was worth to me all that it cost.</p>

<p>In addition to camels I needed more men. The four who had been
hired in Cairo, Sollum, and Siwa were still with me: Abdullahi,
Ahmed, Hamad, and Ismail. I now added five more: Zerwali; Senussi
Bu Hassan, the guide; Sad, who came from Aujila; Hamid; and Faraj,
a slave. Bu Helega had with him his son and two camelmen. The list
was supplemented at the last by five Tebus, nomadic blacks from
Tibesti, a region northwest of Wadai. Abdullahi and Zerwali were
the two headmen of the caravan. The former was in command of the
luggage and the commissariat, while Zerwali was in charge of the
camels and the men. They were the best companions that any man
could have on a desert trek.</p>

<p>We needed clothing, certain articles of food, and shoes,
especially the last. The heelless Bedouin slipper is the only
possible wear for the desert, but it will wear out, and it often
has to be repaired on the way. It was necessary to be sure that
each of us had not only shoes but the leather that we should need
for patching them until we reached Kufra.</p>

<p>At Jalo I found a famous shoemaker, Hemaida, whom I had met at
Kufra two years before. I had with me the very shoes that he had
made for me then, with soles badly in need of patching. Great was
his delight when I took them to him for his ministrations. He was a
venerable-looking personage, whom it would have been easy to take
for a judge or a member of the council at least. He came to my
house day after day to work on the five pairs of shoes he made for
me, on the making of shoes for my men, and on the repairing of our
saddles and other leather accoutrement. It was a pleasure to give
him a meal and then to invite him to a friendly glass of tea. One
day he was coughing as the tea was brought, and I expressed
sympathy for his ailment. He looked at me across his glass of tea
and answered in his quiet voice: “But your tea always stops my
cough, Sidi El Bey. Not other tea, but yours always does.” I did
not ignore the hint so gracefully given. Hemaida received his
little packet of the miraculous tea as a present before we left
Jalo.</p>

<p>Besides my shoes and the leather, I bought cloth for clothing
for my men, butter, oil, barley, fire-wood, and eight
<i>girbas</i>. Ali Kaja, who was the favorite slave of Sayed Idris
and had been made by him his trusted personal <i>wakil</i> in Jalo,
told me that his master had directed him to put all his store of
supplies of every kind at my disposal. I thanked him but did not
avail myself of the offer. I had just come from Egypt, well
equipped, and I knew how much these stores meant to those who lived
in this isolated spot.</p>

<p>Besides the making of preparations, my ten days in Jalo were
spent in receiving and giving entertainment and in scientific work.
The entertainment was up to the best Bedouin standards. The first
day I dined with Senussi Gader Bouh, the <i>kaimakam</i> or
governor of Jalo. The second day I lunched at the house of El
Bishari, the most important of the Majabra merchant chiefs, waited
on by my host and his sons. The third day luncheon was sent to me
by the members of the council, and I was joined in the repast by
Zerwali, the <i>kadi</i> or judge, Ali Kaja, and Moghaib. After the
meal I had a talk with the <i>kadi</i> on Senussi history and was
shown letters from the Grand Senussi and from El Mahdi, his son.
Dinner that day came from Haj Farahat, another Majbari merchant,
with the <i>kaimakam</i>, Zerwali, Ali Kaja, Moghaib, and Abdullahi
as sharers of the feast. We discussed the custom of Bu Zafar, which
all agreed must not be a meal but the slaughtering and eating of a
sheep.</p>

<p>On the fourth day I lunched at the house of Haj Ali Bilal, a
Majbari. My diary records the fact that there was the “usual crowd”
and a “very good lunch.” Dinner was sent to me by Haj Seid, also
one of the Majabra merchants, and the <i>kaimakam</i>, Zerwali, and
the <i>kadi</i> joined me in it. On the next day I lunched at the
house of Haj Ghraibil, and that evening my most interesting
experience in the way of hospitality took place. There were living
at Jalo several ladies of the Senussi family, including the wife of
Sayed Idris and his sister. Shortly after my arrival at Jalo they
sent me an invitation to dinner. This was an unusual occurrence,
for Bedouin women of high class do not offer entertainment to men
as women of the western world may do with perfect propriety. I
realized, of course, that I would not actually dine with my
hostesses in person, but I was appreciative of the unprecedented
honor nevertheless.</p>

magnificent brass lantern and innumerable candles served to deepen
the mellow tones and the rich combinations of color of priceless
rugs and silken cushions. Sidi Saleh, who was the husband of one of
the Senussi ladies, acted as host on their behalf. Under his
hospitable direction, a splendid banquet was served to us by half a
dozen slaves. When we had eaten all that was demanded by courtesy,
and, I am afraid, much more than was required by nature, the
banquet was completed with the washing of our hands in basins
brought by the slaves, the ceremonial three glasses of tea, the
sprinkling over us of rose-water, and the burning of incense before
us. Then the chief slave came and deferentially whispered in my
ear. Would the bey care to hear some music? There was a gramophone,
with records made by the famous singers of Egypt. The bey had only
to command.</p>

<p>Perhaps to the disappointment of my companions—I do not know—but
quite to my own satisfaction, I courteously declined the offered
entertainment. There was something rare and precious in the
perfumed atmosphere of that softly lighted room which the coming of
voices from beyond the desert would have profaned. Partly the
beauty of the place, the remoteness from the world, but especially
the sense that I was the guest of noble Bedouin women, who were
hidden from me by the customs of our eastern lands, but were in a
real sense present through their gracious hospitality and kindly
thoughtfulness, made of that evening a unique memory. I told the
slave to convey my respectful salaams to the ladies and to tell
them how much I had been touched by their courtesy. Then I went out
into the clear desert night with the soft breeze stirring little
breaths of incense from the folds of my <i>jerd</i> to remind me
vividly of the peace and mystic calm of the room from which I had
come.</p>

<p>The next day I returned the hospitality of those who had
entertained me so generously. My room, with its dry mud floor, and
travel-stained luggage ranged about the walls, could not bear
comparison with the charming apartment in which I had dined the
night before. But Ali Kaja took it upon himself to see that we were
made as presentable as circumstances would permit. With a pair of
beautiful brass lanterns and a few rugs borrowed from Sayed Idris’s
house and some other accessories, he created a very decent
imitation of a banquet-hall. My guests included the
<i>kaimakam</i>; the members of the council; the two <i>ikhwan</i>;
the judge; Ali Kaja; Musa, the captain of the Senussi artillery;
and Zerwali. Dressed in my best Bedouin robes I waited on them as a
Bedouin host should, and when some of them, who had been out into
the world, asked me to sit with them and eat, I assured them that I
would—when they were my guests in Cairo. Ahmed, my cook, had laid
himself out to provide several distinctively European dishes to
give a note of novelty to our entertaining, and the delight of my
guests was great at his achievements.</p>

<p>My banquet ended the round of entertaining, and for a day or two
I was permitted to lunch and dine in peaceful solitude. It was a
relief, grateful though I had been to my generous hosts for their
hospitality.</p>

<p>An important part of my activities at Jalo was the making of
scientific observations. I observed the sun and the stars to
determine the latitude and longitude and took regular readings of
the aneroid barometer and thermometer for the determination of the
altitude. My observations on the latter point, when finally worked
out in relation to barometric records made on the same days at
Siwa, disclosed the interesting fact that the level of Jalo is
sixty meters higher to-day than it was when Rohlfs ascertained it
in 1879. He found Jalo almost exactly at sea-level; I found it
sixty meters higher. I saw the explanation of it going on before my
eyes. The drifting sands were climbing slowly up the trunks of the
palm-trees and against the walls of the houses, threatening to
engulf them. Some of the inhabitants had already moved their houses
and rebuilt them on higher levels. It is the steadily accumulating
sand, driven by sand-storms and gathering wherever trees and houses
stop its progress, that has raised Jalo nearly two hundred feet
above sea-level in forty-four years. The house I was living in, and
at which the barometric readings were recorded, was from fifteen to
twenty meters higher than the rest of the houses at Jalo.</p>

<p>In the taking of my observations I had to be cautious, for the
Bedouins are suspicious of anything so elaborately scientific
looking as a theodolite. They were sure to say that I was making a
map with a view to coming back and conquering their land. The first
time that a Bedouin chief and the man who was to guide us to Kufra
caught me at my theodolite I had to explain hastily and
persuasively that I was getting data for the making of a calendar
for the month of Ramadan.</p>

<p>Abdullahi, who was of course not a Bedouin, was invaluable to me
in the camouflaging of my scientific activities. In fact he was
rather a specialist in the manufacture of those little inaccuracies
that smooth the path of life and preserve the social amenities. One
day we were using the theodolite some distance from the town. A
native demanded what we were doing, and Abdullahi said we were
taking a picture of Jalo.</p>

<p>“How can that be, at such a distance?” demanded the Bedouin.</p>

<p>Abdullahi had his explanation ready.</p>

<p>“The machine attracts the picture, so that it comes right out
and flies into it,” he asserted glibly.</p>

<p>“But how can a box attract a picture?” demanded the incredulous
Bedouin.</p>

<p>Abdullahi struck an attitude. “Ask the magnet how it attracts
the iron,” he commanded rhetorically, and the debate was
closed.</p>

<h2><a id="chap11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class="sub_chapter">ON THE TREK</p>

<p>On Thursday, March 15, we were ready to trek. I got up at six to
pack and get my baggage ready. As is usual on the first day of a
journey, when the caravan is not yet shaken down and accustomed to
the routine, it took us three hours to load. We were to follow the
Bedouin custom of <i>tag-heez</i>, which means going to a near-by
well before beginning a journey and spending several days,
sometimes a week, in final preparations away from the distractions
of town life. Buttafal Well, thirty kilometers from Jalo, was the
point where we were to make our <i>tag-heez</i>, or
preparation.</p>

<p>When the packing was well under way, the <i>kaimakam</i>,
notables, and <i>ikhwan</i> came to give us the ceremonial
<i>mowad-a</i> or farewell. We squatted down together and discussed
the prospects for the journey. I had made this same trip to Kufra
two years before under somewhat more favorable conditions and
nevertheless we had lost our way before getting to Kufra. It had
been cooler then, two months earlier in the year; the winds and
sand-storms had not been so incessant; and the caravan had been
smaller.</p>

<p>The problem of providing camels, their fodder, men, and food and
equipment for the men did not arise then, as the whole caravan was
produced complete and provided for by the generosity of Sayed
Idris, a fact which had a considerable effect in lulling the
suspicions of the Bedouins and subduing their hostility to
strangers. On this occasion, I had to arrange for the camels and
personnel, and so big a caravan journeying with the quantity of
unusual luggage necessary for a long journey naturally aroused
curiosity.</p>

<p>On these long waterless treks Nature is often the only enemy;
and she can be one if she chooses. The men of my caravan worked
well together. The four whom I had brought from Cairo, Sollum, and
Siwa got on excellently with all the people we met. Zerwali, the
Senussi <i>ikhwan</i> delegated by Sayed Idris to accompany us, was
kindness itself and did everything in his power to make the journey
as comfortable as possible. I felt no real concern over the
outcome, no matter what Nature might choose to do.</p>

<p>When the camels were all loaded, we went through the dignified
ceremony of the farewell. We took our stand in two half-circles
facing each other, the men of my caravan and myself in one and the
chiefs of Jalo and the <i>ikhwan</i> in the other. Solemnly and
reverently we raised our hands, palm upward, for prayers that the
journey would be a blessed one, that God would guide us and return
us safe to our homes. We read the “Fat-ha,” the first chapter of
the Koran, the oldest of the <i>ikhwan</i> saying the “amen.” Then
we shook hands and parted. The shouts of the men urging on the
camels were echoed by “lu lias” from women of the village, and we
were on our way.</p>

<p>As we passed El Lebba, the second village of Jalo, a pleasant
incident occurred to send us cheerfully on our way. The solitary
graceful figure of a girl appeared beside our path, her face hidden
from us by the Bedouin veil. With one voice the men nearest her
called out the traditional greeting:</p>

<p>“Wajhik! Wajhik! Your face! Your face!”</p>

<p>The girl turned and demurely drew aside her veil to disclose the
finely chiseled features, the clear olive skin, and the shy yet
dignified expression of a Bedouin maiden. The men shouted with
delight at her beauty and her courtesy. To complete the tradition I
ordered them to “empty gunpowder” at her feet. Hamad and Sad
performed the graceful ceremony, first one and then the other. The
man danced lightly toward her as if to the imaginary rhythm of a
Bedouin drum, his rifle held in both hands over his head, the
muzzle pointing forward, shouting a desert love-song as he went.
Just in front of her he dropped lightly on one knee, brought his
gun to the vertical position butt upward, and fired, a hair’s
breadth from her feet.</p>

</div></div>

<p>So close was the shot and so accurate his aim that the girl’s
slippers were singed by the powder-flash. She did not flinch at the
explosion but stood gracefully erect in her pride at the honor done
her. Singed slippers are a mark of distinction in the desert that
any Bedouin girl cherishes.</p>

<p>When Sad had followed Hamad’s example, another shout rose from
the men of the caravan, and we moved on.</p>

<p>The girl smiled after us, as flattered by the homage that had
been paid her as we were by the good omen of a pretty face crossing
our path at the outset of our journey. Within an hour we were in
the open desert again.</p>

<p>Eight hours’ trekking brought us to Buttafal Well, where we were
to stop a day. We took matters easily that first night, with
singing and conversation about the camp-fire till after
midnight.</p>

<p>When the camp had settled down for the night, I took my pipe and
went for a stroll. This was always one of the pleasures of my life
in the desert—that last pipe of peace before turning in—and of
peace it always was. If the day had been good, there was
contentment; if bad, there was hope for the next day and faith that
all would be well. During the whole journey, I never went to sleep
with anything really worrying me; worrying, that is, my mind
itself, no matter how I might have been tried by occurrences or by
conditions.</p>

<p>The next day was spent in final preparations. Bu Helega, the
owner of the camels, arrived with his own little caravan of three
camels. During the day another man had come from Jalo to catch up
with us. We had been in need of rope and twine, but the price asked
by the dealers had been too high. So Abdullahi chattered with them
and left the actual closing of the bargain to the last minute. Then
he had arranged with a man named Senussi Bu Jabir to bring the rope
after us to Buttafal.</p>

<p>When this man arrived, he came to my tent to tell me that his
brother was in Wadai and to ask me to take him with us. He would
work to pay for his passage. I looked him over and quickly decided
that he would do. I discovered particularly that he had a sense of
humor, almost if not quite the most valuable asset in desert
travel. Ability may fail, but a keen sense of humor enables one to
get the last ounce out of a man in possession of it. I was ready to
take him, but it did not seem possible.</p>

<p>“We are leaving at once,” I said. “There is no time for you to
make the day’s journey to Jalo and back for your luggage.”</p>

<p>“I have it,” he said.</p>

<p>“Where is it?” I demanded, looking about in bewilderment.</p>

<p>“Here,” he answered, pointing to the shirt he wore and the stick
he carried.</p>

<p>I burst into a hearty laugh at the idea of such an outfit for a
hard desert trek, and he joined me cheerfully. I assured him that
he might go and never regretted my decision. He proved to be one of
the best men I had.</p>

<p>The next morning we watered the camels, a process which must not
be hurried. Nothing is more important in trekking than the
condition of your camels. Not only must they be fat and well
nourished at the start, but they must be allowed to drink their
fill with deliberation and permitted to rest after the
drinking.</p>

<p>When the camels were ready they were loaded with the greatest
care, for good packing and loading at the beginning mean time and
trouble saved all through the journey. The rapidity with which the
loading and unloading can be accomplished day after day sometimes
means a gain of a day or two in time before the trip is over.</p>

<p>At 2:30 we were ready to start. As the camels moved slowly off,
the sonorous voice of Bu Helega rose in the <i>azan</i>, the
calling to prayers, according to the Bedouin custom at the
beginning of a long trek. It is the Bedouin tradition that those
who begin the journey with the <i>azan</i> will end it with the
<i>azan</i>; they will, that is, meet with no disaster by the
way.</p>

<p>Our caravan had gradually become enlarged until it consisted of
thirty-nine camels, twenty-one men, a horse, and a dog. Our
personnel was as follows: myself and my four men, Abdullahi, Ahmed,
Hamad, and Ismail; Zerwali; Bu Helega, the owner of the camels with
his son, his nephew, and his slave. There was also Dawood,
Zerwali’s uncle, who was going with a single camel to Taiserbo to
bring back his wife and daughter; Senussi Bu Hassan, our guide;
Senussi Bu Jabir, the boy with the shirt and staff; Hamad Zwayi,
another boy who was a pleasant singer; Sad, the Aujili; Faraj, the
slave; two Tebus, with their three camels. In addition there were
three other Tebus with three camels loaded with merchandise which
they were taking to deliver to merchants in Kufra.</p>

<p>We set our faces southward and journeyed toward Kufra. It was
hot and windy, and the desert lay about us like an interminable
pancake. The ground was <i>serira</i>, which is flat hard sand,
with a little gravel scattered over it. Our first objective was the
Zieghen Well, which we ought to make in eight or nine days. In the
old days, before the times of the Senussis, it had been the custom
to make the trek from Jalo to Zieghen in three days and five
nights, marching continuously without a stop for food or rest. But
the Senussis changed all that. They inaugurated the custom of
taking enough water and food to permit the journey to be made in
twice the time, with adequate rest for camels and men each day.</p>

<p>SOUTH OF KUFRA<br>
The caravan on the hitherto unexplored desert. The route from this
point to Erdi, by way of Arkenu and Ouenat, had never before been
traversed by any one from the outside world.</p>
</div></div>

<p>At first our camels moved reluctantly, for they had just left
good grazing and would much rather have gone back to it. Bu Helega
tried his best to persuade the trading Tebus to lead the caravan
with their camels, but they cleverly refused. The place of honor at
the head of the line is an arduous one. Camels are quite ready to
follow others ahead of them but dislike to go forward
independently. So the first camel in the caravan has to be driven
and often beaten with a stick to keep him going. The Tebus
preferred to bring up the trail of the procession, where their
camels needed no urging. Bu Helega got even with them later,
however, because of their choice of position.</p>

<p>It was hot and windy all the afternoon, but in the evening the
wind dropped to a gentle breeze, and the desert put forth its full
charm. I find recorded in my diary some of the thoughts and
feelings on getting back into this old familiar desert, where I was
approaching the point at which we lost our way two years
before.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>The same old flat desert and feelings of old memories.</p>

<p>How one forgives the Desert her scorching sun and her torturing
wind for the calm of the evening, the sunset, the moon rising, and
then that gentle and serene breeze! How easily one forgets the
presence of her dangers! It is the full appreciation of simple
pleasures that endears the Desert to one, in spite of all her
harshnesses and crudities:</p>

<p>A glass of tea;</p>

<p>A cigarette;</p>

<p>A pipe when all the caravan is asleep and the fragrance of the
tobacco is wafted by the gently stirring air;</p>

<p>A glimpse of the playing of the firelight on the faces of the
men of the caravan, some old and rugged, some smooth and
youthful;</p>

<p>To see men toil, succeed and fail, and suffer in another sphere
of life;</p>

<p>Above all, to be near to God and to feel His Presence.</p>
</div>

<p>On the eighteenth we got up at six, and the camels were briskly
loaded in thirty-five minutes. The careful first loading at Jalo
and Buttafal made speed possible now. Nevertheless it was nine
o’clock before we were ready for the start. The morning program in
camp is not one that can be safely hurried. The Bedouin dislikes
intensely to be rushed over his meals, or to be deprived of those
moments of leisure thereafter which are so essential to peaceful
digestion and a contented spirit. The wise leader will see that
these prejudices of his men are carefully observed.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is a good place to set down the outline of a
typical day’s trek under the conditions which prevailed until we
reached Arkenu.</p>

<p>Although it is March, it is still cold in the morning, and one
gets up a little after dawn because it is too cold to stay in bed
longer. Even the sleeping-bag and the Bedouin blanket will not keep
out the chill. A peep through the flaps of the tent shows that the
stars are paling in the sky. Some one has the fire already started,
and the first impulse is to get to it without delay. Throwing my
<i>jerd</i> about me and wrapping the <i>kufia</i> about my ears, I
dash out to the crackling blaze. There is nothing hot about the
desert in these crisp morning hours. I stand by the fire and have a
look around. There is little life in the camp yet, though all the
men are up. They are huddled close to the warmth, muffled in
<i>jerds</i> and every other garment that they can lay their hands
on. When water is plenty, steaming hot glasses of tea are handed
round, and after they are drunk the activities of the camp divide.
The camelmen go to feed the camels with dried dates, which the
beasts munch reflectively, stones and all. A consultation is
sometimes held over the camels, if some of them have suffered the
previous day from too heavy loads. Perhaps a shifting of loads is
decided on or better packing and loading recommended.</p>

<p>Other men are pulling down the three tents, which form the
apices of a triangle, with the camels parked at its center. The
luggage which had been set up as a barricade against the icy wind
is sorted out and arranged ready for the loading.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I have been attending to the barometer and
thermometer, registering their readings, filling in the spaces in
my scientific diary, seeing that the cameras have fresh films. The
voices of the men sound low through the camp, muffled by
<i>kufias</i> and extra clothing. At last breakfast is ready.</p>

<p>It may be <i>asida</i>, the Bedouin national dish, a kind of
pudding baked of flour, oil, and spices; or it may be rice. It is
an utterly simple meal in either case, but with what a keen
appetite one attacks it! In the desert any disinclination for the
first meal of the day that one may feel in city surroundings
vanishes away. Breakfast is finished off with the inevitable three
glasses of tea, taken slowly and reflectively. Whatever one does,
one must not deprive one’s men of their tea or hurry them over it.
Give a Bedouin a filling meal and let him sip three glasses of tea
after it, and you can get any work out of him that you want. Stint
him or rush him, and you will get worse than nothing.</p>

<p>RUINS OF KUFRA</p>
</div></div>

<p>After breakfast every one is warm and contented and ready to
work hard. The loading goes on swiftly, diversified at times by the
antics of the two or three young and frolicsome camels that seem to
get into every caravan. These young fellows resist being loaded and
even throw off their loads when the job is apparently all finished.
Zerwali and Abdullahi are alert to see that the loading is done
with the utmost care and precision. An extra half-hour spent now
may save two or three hours’ delay on the road later caused by
slipping of the loads or improper distribution of the burdens.</p>

<p>When the caravan is all but ready, I have a few words with the
guide about the direction of our day’s march. He draws a line on
the sand and says that there lies our way. I take a bearing of the
line with my compass, a proceeding which doubtless seems to him an
absurd if harmless idiosyncrasy of mine. But I like to be able to
check with the compass the direction the caravan is taking as the
day goes on. On the whole the precaution proves unnecessary,
however, for Senussi Bu Hassan goes straight to his mark as a
homing pigeon. Only in the middle of the day he sometimes wabbles a
bit. In the daytime he travels by his shadow, and, as he explains,
“When the sun is high and the shadow lies between my feet, then my
head goes round.” There is one other hour in the day when the
guide’s task is a perplexing one. In the twilight hour between the
setting of the sun and the appearance of the stars, all directions
on the desert’s vast disk are the same. Then sometimes the compass
is useful. Once, by means of the bearing I had taken in the
morning, I caught the guide in the hour between sun and stars going
almost ninety degrees off the right direction. But as a rule the
accuracy with which a good guide, like Senussi Bu Hassan, steers
his course is almost uncanny.</p>

<p>Our conference over and the last camel loaded, the guide sets
out ahead, and one by one the camels follow. The men of the caravan
have a last warm-up of hands and feet at the dying fire, thrust
their feet into the Bedouin shoes, and hasten after the camels,
singing gaily. The sun is getting warm by now, and unless there is
a strong wind blowing from the north one disposes quickly of
wrappings on ears and neck and finally with the <i>jerd</i>. The
extra garments are flung on the backs of the camels, jokes begin to
crack, foot-races are run, and everybody is happy to be alive.
Gradually the men sort themselves into groups of two and three,
spaced at intervals along the caravan, chatting about their own
affairs or about things in general. Sometimes I walk at the head of
the caravan and again some distance behind it, to keep an eye on
the direction it is taking and especially to enjoy the sense of
solitude and remoteness.</p>

<p>Toward midday, contemplation of the beauties of nature is
sometimes disturbed by other and less romantic thoughts. My mind
occasionally wanders toward favorite restaurants in far-away
civilization. As I stride along I imagine myself in Shepheard’s
Grill-Room in Cairo and I order <i>crevettes à l’américaine</i>
with that subtle variation of <i>riz à l’orientale</i> which is a
specialty of the house. Or I am at Prunier’s in Paris ordering
<i>marennes vertes d’Ostende</i>, followed by a steak and a
<i>soufflé</i>. Perhaps it is the Cova at Milan and a succulent
dish of <i>risotto alla Milanese</i>; maybe strawberries Melba at
the Ritz in London, or again a Circassian dish of rice with walnut
sauce which is the masterpiece of the old and beloved slave who
really rules my father’s house in Cairo, occupying the privileged
position of a treasured Nannie of long service in an English
family.</p>

<p>Suddenly Ahmed or Abdullahi comes along and without a word
pushes a bag of squashed dates into my palm. Dreams vanish, and I
eat with as much appetite as though there were no better fare in
all the world.</p>

<p>There is no halt for lunch, as the camels eat only twice a day.
If we have just left an oasis, there is fresh bread, half a loaf or
even a whole one to each man, with dates. Later on that fresh bread
becomes hard bread, and still later no bread at all. But there are
always dates.</p>

<p>I have one camel fitted up with a folded tent over its back so
that any one of us may lie and take his ease when tired of walking.
Ahmed calls it “the Club.” One day at the lunch hour Abdullahi
demands where I am and whether I have had my portion of bread and
dates or not, and Ahmed replies, with a twinkling eye in an
otherwise grave face, “The bey is lunching at the Club to-day.”</p>

<p>It is entirely possible, when you are used to it, to have a good
nap on the camel’s back, and an occasional ride is not to be
scorned. But generally one walks, for the camel’s pace of two and a
half miles an hour is an easy one to keep up with, and riding is
often more tiring than going on foot.</p>

<p>Sometimes during a whole day’s trek a narrow strip of water lies
shimmering on the horizon ahead of the caravan. It never gets any
nearer but continues to beckon a cool and pleasant invitation until
the sun has rolled round to the west and the mirage vanishes away.
It is a purely optical illusion, for there is no water there.
Another kind of mirage comes sometimes in the early morning. Then
the country far ahead of one appears in the sky at the horizon, as
the Bedouins say, “upside down.” This is not, as the other variety
of mirage is, entirely an illusion. It is really the reversed
reflection of the country thirty or forty kilometers ahead of where
the observer stands. As the sun rises higher above the horizon,
suddenly the mirage vanishes as magically as it came. There are
also other tricks of reflection of light in the desert. Sometimes,
for instance, a small pebble the size of a cricket-ball seen from a
mile away might assume the appearance of a big rock, standing like
a landmark. The skeleton or part of the skeleton of a camel or a
human being may take on the most fantastic shapes on the horizon,
but the Bedouins know it well.</p>

<p>It is absurd to say that the Bedouin is lured by the mirage out
of his way and even to his destruction. The seasoned desert
traveler knows a mirage when he sees one. It is entirely possible
indeed that the “upside down” variety may be a positive assistance,
since it can suggest what kind of country lies ahead. The mirage is
an interesting phenomenon, but it is not one of the perils of
desert travel.</p>

<p>In the afternoon there are several hours of heat, the pace of
the camels slackens, and the whole caravan becomes quiet and
somnolent. As evening comes on and it grows cool again, the camels
pick up their speed and go into a final spurt before the time for
making camp. The men sing to the camels then to stimulate their
efforts, and the beasts respond cheerfully to the
encouragement.</p>

<p>The songs are simple and poetic, full of the atmosphere of the
desert life. One of them represents a Bedouin waiting at an oasis
for the expected caravan.</p>

<p>He sings to the approaching camels:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“Gone is the night;</div>

<div class="verse indent0">&nbsp;Come are the Marazan? to the
morning sky.</div>

<div class="verse indent0">&nbsp;You are here—</div>

<div class="verse indent0">&nbsp;And vanished are all our
fears.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The singer speaks of his camels:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“In companies the sand-dunes</div>

<div class="verse indent0">&nbsp;Marched to meet them,</div>

<div class="verse indent0">&nbsp;Pointing the homeward way.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The singer addresses his camels:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“The sand-dunes hide many wells</div>

<div class="verse indent0">&nbsp;That brim with waters
unfailing.</div>

<div class="verse indent0">&nbsp;You come to their margins like
bracelets</div>

<div class="verse indent0">&nbsp;Wrought of gold and rare gems in
far countries.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In another the singer is still addressing his camels:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“The wells lie hid in the dunes</div>

<div class="verse indent0">&nbsp;Masked by the sands drifted over
them.</div>

<div class="verse indent0">&nbsp;You approach them in ones and
twos,</div>

<div class="verse indent0">&nbsp;O you who reveal hidden
places.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The last song that I shall set down shows the traditional
attitude of the Bedouin to his camel. It is his most precious
possession. To give it up without a struggle to the death is
dishonor. A Bedouin might wait to take revenge for the killing of a
brother or a son, but if his camel were stolen he would not rest
until he found it and brought it back, by force of arms if
necessary. “He who will not risk his life for his camel,” says the
Bedouin, “does not deserve to have it.” So the camel-driver sings
to his beast:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">“For your sakes,</div>

<div class="verse indent0">&nbsp;O ye who cherish us</div>

<div class="verse indent0">&nbsp;As loving mothers their
children,</div>

<div class="verse indent0">&nbsp;For your sakes</div>

<div class="verse indent0">&nbsp;The sons of nobles</div>

<div class="verse indent0">&nbsp;Have lain stark on the
sands,</div>

<div class="verse indent0">&nbsp;Unsheltered by tomb or
burial.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The men suit the song to the occasion. The first one that I have
translated might be used when an oasis was not far off, the second
when the caravan is approaching sand-dune country, the third and
fourth when they are nearing a well, and the last when entering a
hostile region.</p>

<p>At sunset I make it a point to be near the guide and
unobtrusively to check him up with my compass in those uncertain
hours before the stars come out. When the dark falls a lantern is
lighted and given to the guide. Then we follow that elusive
pin-point of yellow in the darkness. It winks a provocative
invitation to follow, but we can never reach it. The camels like to
have the lantern ahead of them and move briskly forward in pursuit.
Twelve or thirteen hours of walking, if conditions have been good,
bring us to the end of the day’s trek, though sometimes we cannot
go on so long.</p>

<p>“<i>Eddar ya ayan</i>; home for you who are weary,” is shouted
by the guide and repeated by every man in the caravan. Then the men
collect the camels and divide them, the water-camels here, those
carrying tents over there, the camels with luggage for the
barricade yonder. The camels are <i>barrakked</i>— kneel with
grunts of satisfaction to have their loads removed. Now we must be
vigilant, for men tired by a day’s trek are likely to be careless
and let boxes with precious instruments or cameras fall with
disastrous violence.</p>

<p>The baggage is arranged in a barricade, if the night promises to
be windy, and the tents are pitched in their triangle, unless the
night is particularly calm and pleasant. I could never decide which
moment was fuller of satisfaction, that in which the tent was set
up after a hard day’s trek or that in which it was pulled down
preliminary to taking the road again.</p>

<p>Then the fire is built and the leaping flames of the
<i>hatab</i> throw a warm glow over the sand. The first thing is
tea. Now I realize to the full the virtues of the dark bitter-sweet
liquid that the Bedouins know by that name. They make tea by taking
a handful of the leaves and a handful of sugar and boiling them
briskly in a pint of water. The result would drive a housewife of
the West almost insane, but it is a wonderful stimulant after a
hard day’s trek in the desert and a glorious reviver of one’s
energies and spirits.</p>

<p>ZWAYA CHIEFS AT KUFRA</p>
</div></div>

<p>The men of the caravan are not slow to prepare and eat the
evening meal, to feed the camels, and then to dispose themselves
for sleep. But I must compare my six watches and wind them, record
the photographs made during the day, change the cinema films in the
darkness, no mean feat in itself, label and store the geological
specimens I have collected, and write up my diaries. The glasses of
Bedouin tea which I have drunk help me to accomplish these duties
and then probably stimulate me to a walk in the desert. If there is
no bitter cold wind I go for perhaps half a mile, looking back from
time to time at the silhouette of the caravan against the sky. The
dark masses of the tents, the baggage, and the kneeling camels,
touched here and there with flickers of light from the dying fire,
in the midst of that immense sea of sand, make a picture full of
mystery and fascination. All about me is silence. There is no wind
whispering in the leaves, no murmur of the waters of a brook, such
as one hears in the wooded wilds; no slap and plash and swish of
waves against the ship’s side such as are always present at sea.
Nothing but silence. Silence, the sands, and the stars.</p>

<h2><a id="chap12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class="sub_chapter">THE ROAD TO ZIEGHEN WELL</p>

<p>From this point I shall set down the days as they are recorded
in my diary.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p><em>Sunday, March 18.</em> Start at 9 <span class="sc2">A.
M.</span>, halt at 8:30 <span class="sc2">P. M.</span> Make 46
kilometers. Highest temperature 21°, lowest 3°. Cloudy all day,
clear in evening. Just a few drops of rain in the afternoon. Strong
northeast wind, which develops at 2:30 into a sand-storm. Wind
drops at sunset and gets up again at eight in the evening. The sun
not visible and the guide’s course not so straight as usual, as
shown by the compass bearings which I take often during the day. At
5:30 the sun appears and he corrects his course; at 7:30 he is
traveling by the North Star, which the Bedouins call El Jadi. The
ground is generally the same as yesterday’s though slightly
undulating. At intervals all day we come across patches of big
dark-colored pebbles.</p>
</div>

<p>In the morning there was excitement when we sighted on the
horizon the series of hazy dots that meant the approaching vanguard
of a caravan. My binoculars were brought into play and passed
around among the men. Rifles were unslung from their places on the
camels’ backs, and the Tebus ran to get their spears. The men
ranged themselves on the side of the caravan nearest the on-comers
and held themselves alert until we should find out whether they
were friendly or hostile. It did not take long to recognize them
for friends. Then men from each party met and squatted down between
the two caravans to exchange the news, while the two lines of
camels plodded past. Tongues flew as they heard and told who had
been married, who was dead, who had made money, what new feuds had
arisen, or what old ones had been ended. Then the envoys sprang up,
bade each other God-speed, and hastened after their respective
caravans. (This is the desert wireless at work.)</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p><em>Monday, March 19.</em> Start at 8:15 <span class="sc2">A.
M.</span>, halt at 8:30 <span class="sc2">P. M.</span> Make 49
kilometers. Highest temperature 22°, lowest 5°. Weather fine and
clear. Strong northeast wind which drops at midday. Few white
clouds in the afternoon. Sun is very warm, making our progress
slow, but evening is cool and the pace is quickened. Ground very
flat, hard sand covered with fine gravel. At six in the evening
cross a slight depression, with a patch of gray stone on the right
and a white stone on our left about 2 kilometers distant.</p>
</div>

<p>All of us, men and camels, were getting into our stride. The
Bedouins and Tebus indulged in foot-races and played practical
jokes. The Tebus are simple, primitive fellows, with delightfully
naïve habits of mind. Being poor, they take the best of care of
what possessions they have. They dress in a simple cotton shirt and
pair of drawers, and devote much attention to making these garments
last as long as possible. When a Tebu rides a camel, for example,
he takes off his drawers to save wear and tear, and hangs them on
his camel’s back. When he sleeps also he removes his garments to
protect them from friction against the sand and wraps himself in
his fur cloak.</p>

<div class="figcenter iw1">
<a id="illus37"></a>
<br>
<img src="images/illus37.jpg" alt="">
<div>
<p>THE LAKE AT KUFRA<br>
The water is salt and fed with salt springs. There are no fish and
only a few water hens and ducks. The lake is about two or three
square miles in area.</p>
</div></div>

<p>While one of the Tebus was riding that day some of the Bedouins
took his drawers and hid them. When he alighted and looked for his
garment, he immediately feared that it had dropped off and lay
somewhere in the desert along our track. Without a moment’s
hesitation he set out on the back track, running briskly in search
of his precious possession. He had become a tiny figure in the vast
expanse of sand before we took pity on him and fired shots to call
him to return. He turned reluctantly and soon rejoined us with
downcast face. But the merriment of the jokers told him that
something was up, and when his drawers were produced he was too
pleased to get them back to resent the joke.</p>

<p>The previous night some of the camels paid a visit to my tent
and threatened to have it down on top of me. They are clever
beasts. They like to scratch their necks on the tent-ropes, and
when all the camp is asleep they hobble in quest of this innocent
form of diversion. First the camel sticks his head through the flap
of my tent to see if I am awake. If he does not hear me resent his
intrusion, he then knows I am asleep, and out he backs and sets to
scratching vigorously. Soon he is joined by others, and I awake
under the impression that my tent is being assailed by a violent
storm.</p>

<p>Each day I was more impressed with Bu Helega as a traveling
companion. He was a man of few words, with a big heart and generous
spirit. His years and his white hair and beard gained him the
respect of all of us, for in the desert the man of experience, who
is possessed of the wisdom that comes with age, is the invaluable
one. Zerwali and I, therefore, referred continually to Bu Helega’s
judgment. He was tactful in offering his suggestions for my
consideration, but I was wise enough not to disregard them.</p>

<p>He was constantly on the lookout for the well-being of the
camels, and his splendid voice was heard at intervals through the
day addressing the camels or the men.</p>

<p>“The white camel is weary. To-morrow, Ibrahim, we will shift its
load to the old brown one,” he says to his slave.</p>

<p>“Talk to them, men, talk to them,” he commands, knowing how much
better the camels travel under encouragement, and again, “Sing to
them, Ibrahim.”</p>

<p>“Follow the guide, you beautiful beasts,” he exhorts the
camels.</p>

<p>“Pray, Hamad, that saddle has shifted; it will irritate the
camel’s back.”</p>

<p>When the twilight comes he gives the order, “Light the lantern;
it pleases the camels.”</p>

<p>The qualities of the camel are seldom, if ever, appreciated on a
slight acquaintance. The camel is as clever as a horse, if not more
clever, and in some ways is more human. “Patient as a camel,” is an
Arab saying and a very true one. If you ill-treat a camel he will
never forget it, but he will not attack you on the spot. He will
wait, and if you repeat the offense again and again, he makes up
his mind to get his revenge. Not, however, when there are many
people about. Here he behaves in a most human way. He watches his
chance until you and he are alone, and then he goes for you, either
by snatching at you with his mouth and throwing you to the ground,
or by kicking you and then trampling upon you. There is a case
known where a camel trampled on a man and then sat on him, refusing
to move even after punishment from the men who ran up to the
rescue, wanting to make sure that he had finished his man, as,
indeed, he had.</p>

<p>People imagine that in the desert a camel has to be roped in and
led. As a matter of fact, it is very hard in the desert to keep a
camel away from the rest of the caravan, for instinctively he knows
that to be left behind is death; so he keeps as near the bulk of
the caravan as he can. It is a sad sight to see a camel straggling
behind a caravan. It is like the soldier in retreat, unable to keep
up with his comrades, knowing that nobody can carry him and that to
fall behind means disaster.</p>

<p>The camel also displays his intelligence when he is taken from
the oasis and pushed into the waterless trek. Instinctively he
tries at night, even three or four days after the start, to go back
to the oasis. There have been a few desert tragedies when all the
camels have deserted the men at night, either on the outward or the
home-coming journey, when the caravan was still a few days from its
destination. Or, in the event of some accident befalling a caravan,
camels which have traveled a certain road for ten or fifteen years
will complete the journey alone.</p>

<p>As we were approaching Jalo and three days’ journey from the
camp of the Bedouins from whom I had hired three camels, one of the
latter fell desperately ill. They divided his load between the
other two and left him in the desert, I all the time urging the
Bedouins to kill him and save him the tortures of death. I even
offered to pay them the price of the camel if they would allow me
to put an end to him. But as the camel was a pedigreed beast, they
refused. They said, “He is only feeling tired; he will go at his
leisure back to the camp.” I learned afterward that the camel
reached home safely and was feeling much better!</p>

<p>Instinctively, again, the camel knows that he has a guide, and
if you halt in the middle of the desert to debate some point in
regard to the route, the camels crowd round the guide; the moment
he moves, they follow him, ignoring the presence of every other
member of the caravan, but never overtaking the guide. Or if
occasionally a camel ignores even the guide and goes right ahead of
a caravan, then it is safe for the caravan to follow that camel,
for he certainly knows the place that the caravan is coming to. The
Bedouins say that a camel who has once grazed in an oasis would
find his own way back to that oasis even if he were several days’
journey from it.</p>

<p>There is a famous Bedouin story of the sand-grouse and the camel
who had a competition. The sand-grouse said, “I could lay my eggs
in the desert, travel for days, and come back and hatch them.”</p>

<p>The camel retorted, “If my mother drinks from a well when I am
still in her womb, I could travel days and come back and drink from
the same well.”</p>

<p>I myself have seen a camel head the caravan when we were four
days from a well, the waters of which he had tasted four years
before. There is a well-known case of one camel that saved a
caravan which was going from Dakhla Oasis to the Oasis of Ouenat.
The guide, who had never been to the place before, but was heading
toward it going by the description of another Bedouin, had lost his
bearings, and the caravan wandered for twelve days aimlessly. The
water was exhausted, and they had lost hope. Suddenly one of the
camels headed the caravan, and they followed him. That camel had
been to Ouenat a few years before, and when he was two days’
journey from Ouenat he “smelled the place,” as the Bedouins say,
and landed the caravan right at one of the wells.</p>

<p>In winter the well-trained camel can go for a fortnight without
water, in summer up to twelve days. The Bedouins try to feed their
camels always on grazing grass if they can, but when they take them
to the <i>daffa</i> or long waterless trek, they are fed on dried
dates and, when the Bedouin can afford it, on barley. Most of the
camels found in Cyrenaica are <i>hamla</i> or pack-camels. The best
trotting-camels are Tebus or Touaregs, beautiful white beasts with
slim limbs and graceful lines. The average good day’s work of the
pack-camel is a distance of twenty-five miles. The thoroughbred
Touareg does up to forty, and has been known to do seventy miles at
one stretch.</p>

<p>The camel can become a very affectionate beast and very devoted
to his master. Well-trained trotting-camels or <i>hejins</i> refuse
to get up with anybody on their back but their own master.</p>

<p>As a rule the water is carried on the older and wiser camels,
who go sedately with no attempt to frolic. They realize that they
are carrying the most valuable asset of the whole caravan, and
therefore, the moment the day’s trek is over and we are at the hour
of unloading, these older and wiser camels stand apart from the
rest for fear the sheepskins they are carrying be bumped. I have
also seen camels walk round the camp and approach the sheepskins
lying on the ground, arranged and covered for the night; the camels
would take great care to walk round them. There was one camel that
was trained for a long time to carry my tent and all my books and
instruments. He was only chosen for that task because of his being
a strong and an old camel. Every morning when the loading started
he used to come of his own accord and <i>barrak</i> near my tent
and, in his usual supercilious way, wait for the load to be put on
his back.</p>

<p>The camel is a jealous husband or a faithful wife as the case
may be. The female camels will never leave their lord and master
and always follow him, while woe betide any adventurous male camel
who dares to attempt to “butt in.”</p>

<p>Each morning and evening Bu Helega and I rode together and
talked about camels and the desert and Bedouin history. I was
careful to ask no direct questions, for the Bedouins are suspicious
people ready to mistrust your motives. But casual remarks easily
bring out interesting comments and information.</p>

<p>“There was a time,” said the venerable old man, “when Kufra was
unknown to our people. A Bedouin of the Chawazi tribe, from El
Obayad, a small oasis near Buttafal Well, noticed a crow which kept
flying away to the south and coming back again as regularly as the
sun rises. He watched it for some time and then set out to follow
its course southward. He finally reached Taiserbo and, after a
day’s stop on the outskirts of the oasis, managed to get enough
water to take him back. On his return he told his tribe of
date-trees and water in the heart of the desert. They formed an
expedition which set out for Taiserbo and conquered it, after which
they went on to Buzeima, Ribiana, and eventually to Kufra itself.
So the Bedouins came to Kufra.”</p>

<p>TWO TUAREGS IN WARRIOR ATTIRE</p>
</div></div>

<p>I had been casting covetous eyes on Bu Helega’s horse since
first I saw it in Jalo. Abdullahi had inquired for me whether it
could be bought, but the price was too high. So I affected
indifference and bided my time. No one of Bu Helega’s family rode
the horse but himself. The old man’s dignity would not permit. But
he kindly allowed me to use the animal whenever I wanted to ride.
In fact, on this journey it seemed more mine than his.</p>

<p>Three of the camels were tired and <i>barrakked</i> (knelt down)
without orders. They do not behave in this way unless there is good
reason for it, and so we shifted their loads to let them have a
rest. We lost time in the process but made it up when the cool of
the evening came.</p>

<p>I made it a point to talk with each man in the caravan every
day. It kept things running smoothly, and incidentally I picked up
some interesting information. I learned on this day that the
Bedouins not only knew the tracks of their own camels but can often
tell whether camels which have passed belong to men of the same
tribe or not. Tebu camels they know at once because of the peculiar
shape of their hoofs and the long strides they take. The Tebu
camels are hardier than the Bedouin animals and can be used both in
the northern desert of Cyrenaica and to the south in the Sudan. The
Bedouins change camels at Kufra, when going north or south.</p>

<p>I walked with Senussi Bu Hassan, the guide, and he told me of a
trick used by the Bedouins when they are herding camels or sheep.
They milk the beasts in the morning and bury the milk in a
<i>girba</i> to keep it cool. But desert marauders are clever and
can easily find where a <i>girba</i> has been buried. So the wily
Bedouin buries two <i>girbas</i> one beneath the other. The bottom
one is full of fresh milk and the top one of stale. The thief
discovers the upper <i>girba</i> and looks no further, while the
owner of the <i>girbas</i> finds his fresh milk safe when he
returns at night.</p>

<p>We met flocks of small birds winging their way north. Some of
them were tired and eagerly accepted the water we offered them. One
perched on my hand to drink.</p>

<p>Sometimes near a well, one of those that is better described as
a water-hole, one sees a few wings, feathers, bones of birds that
tell their sad tale. They were probably immigrants who came across
the well and stayed for a few days to recuperate. The well had just
been dug by a passing caravan, water was easily available, and the
birds grew accustomed to the spot. Little by little the sand
drifted up and filled the well, and one day there was no more
water, just a damp patch of sand. Or perhaps the birds arrived
there too exhausted to fly another hundred or two hundred miles in
search of water, so they remained and died.</p>

<p>In the morning at 10:30 we passed sand-dunes, called El
Khweimat, eight or ten kilometers to our left, like small white
tents on the desert as their name indicates. At 4:30 we sighted on
our left at thirty kilometers the landmark called El Ferayeg, four
sand-hills in a row. The name means “the little band” of men. At
6:15 we sighted the top of another landmark known as Mazoul, “the
solitary one,” hazy in the distance to the southeast.</p>

<p>We were all cheered by the sight of these landmarks, which
indicated our progress. We were confident that we had a skilful
guide, but, as the Bedouins say, “the good guide is known only at
the well.” It is only when one has reached the end of the journey
that there is certainty that the right track has been taken.
Senussi Bu Hassan demonstrated his remarkably keen eyesight. Very
early in the morning before breaking camp he announced that he saw
El Khweimat landmark in spite of the morning mist. It was several
hours before other eyes in the caravan could make it out.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we passed camel skeletons lying white on the
sands. Strangely enough this is a cheering sign in the desert, for
two reasons: first, because in the trackless monotony any sign that
others have passed that way is encouraging, and, second, because
the camel-bones are more frequent near the wells. Camels are more
likely to die near the end of a trek, when, if water is scarce,
they have been pushed too hard by their masters. The Bedouins do
not like to use the word “skeleton” when they find such a reminder
that death has come this way. So they euphemistically call it
<i>ghazal</i>, which means gazelle.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p><em>Thursday, March 22.</em> Up at 5:30 <span class="sc2">A.
M.</span> I watched the sun rise at 6:27 <span class="sc2">A.
M.</span> and recorded its time. We started at 8 <span class=
"sc2">A. M.</span> and made forty-eight kilometers over very flat
country, hard sand and gravel. All the morning the Mazoul
sand-dunes were on our left twenty-five kilometers distant, but by
the afternoon we had passed them.</p>
</div>

<p>In the morning I heard Zerwali and Abdullahi discussing this
land of astounding flatness through which we were passing.</p>

<p>“Yes, our country is a blessed one,” said Zerwali.</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed, it has a wonderful future,” answered the man from
Egypt. “It is here, I believe, that the day of reckoning will be
held. It is the only place God could find that would be big enough
and so empty.”</p>

<p>The Tebus were running far and wide, ahead and each side of the
caravan, in search of camel-dung for fuel. They lived their life a
little apart from the others in the caravan, and so they liked to
have their own camp-fire at night a short distance from the main
camp. Camel-dung was the only available fuel. The Tebus, who are
sturdy runners, would go as much as five miles out of their way to
find the precious material. But the Bedouins objected to the Tebus’
habit of running ahead and seizing all the dung. It is an
inflexible rule of the desert that anything found on the way
belongs to him who first touches it, and the Tebus appealed to that
rule for justification. The Bedouins, however, had a telling
retort.</p>

<p>THE CARAVAN ON THE MOVE IN THE DESERT TO AGAH</p>
</div></div>

<p>“You have no guide ahead, nor do you let your camels go first,
where they will not go without the stick,” they said. “You want us
to lead the way for your camels, while you run ahead and seize the
dung. That dung belongs to us who would come upon it first if you
were back with your camels where you belong.”</p>

<p>The controversy grew spirited and was finally brought to me for
judgment. I decreed that the Bedouins were right, and the Tebus
should have no fire of their own. They should, however, be given a
hot meal from the general commissariat every night. The Tebus are
quite different in many of their habits and customs from the
Bedouins. They often do not use fire in the preparation of their
food, though, as I have shown, they do not reject it for comfort
and cheer. They dry the inside of the bark from the top of the
date-tree over a fire and powder it, to use as material for a kind
of pudding. They mix it with dates and locusts, also powdered. They
invite no one to share their meals as the Bedouins invariably do,
nor are they resentful if others do not ask them to share their
food. The Bedouins criticize vigorously this failure in
hospitality, as they consider it. The Tebus leave nothing behind
them on the track, having a superstitious fear that whoever picks
up what they have dropped will get hold of them too. They are fine
physical specimens and good workers, but extremely simple in their
habits of life and mind. They are mixing more and more with the
Bedouins, however, and learning the Bedouin ways.</p>

<p>On this day one of the camels became ill. Bu Helega got down and
walked behind it and then bled it from the tail. We hoped it would
be better after a night’s rest.</p>

<p>As we were sure of our water-supply, we decided to have a glass
of tea. Bu Helega, Zerwali, Abdullahi, and I went on ahead of the
caravan, taking the guide with us to set our course right. When we
were far enough ahead, we quickly made a fire and brewed tea. As
the caravan came up, we handed a glass of tea to each man as he
passed. The caravan did not stop. When the last camel was past us,
we packed up our paraphernalia and hastened to catch up with the
plodding caravan, Bu Helega on his camel, Zerwali and Abdullahi
riding double on a trotting camel, and I on the horse. I must own
Baraka was useful to me for several purposes. With him the camels
could be easily brought back from the grazing-ground, which they
are reluctant to leave to enter the <i>zerira</i> again. I could
ride him to visit places of interest when we halted at oases,
allowing the camels to rest or graze. I could go ahead of the
caravan with him or remain behind to make observations or secure
specimens unwatched by the men. On his back I could make a properly
dignified appearance at the head of my caravan when entering or
leaving an oasis.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p><em>Friday, March 23.</em> We made 36 kilometers. There was a
strong northeast wind the previous night, starting an hour after
midnight. This wind continued all day, increasing from 1 to 3, and
dropped in the evening. It was fair and clear, but cloudy in the
late afternoon. At five in the afternoon we sighted the sand-dunes
called El Mazeel, 25 kilometers toward the southeast.</p>
</div>

<p>The men had become interested in making a full day’s trek, and
exerted every effort to be under way at eight, intending to walk
for twelve hours. But the sick camel interfered with our plans.
When the time came to start, it had to be lifted to its feet. Bu
Helega shook his head and said, “This camel will be flesh to eat
before the day is over.” Two hours later the camel knelt and
refused to rise. In a few minutes it had to be slaughtered. Three
men and two camels were left to bring the flesh after us. Before we
had gone far Bu Helega came trotting up on his horse and said: “It
is a fat camel. Let us stop for a while.”</p>

<p>Knowing the Bedouin’s love of meat, I halted the caravan while a
fire was made and a feast prepared. Every one ate the meat but
myself and my two Egyptian servants. Bu Helega asked why I did not
join the feast, and I told him that I did not care to eat the flesh
of a sick camel.</p>

<p>“It is better than the little fish,” he said, referring to some
tins of sardines which we had with us. “We have seen the camel
slaughtered, but who knows what has happened to the little fish
since they were in the sea?”</p>

<p>The camel’s flesh which was not eaten at once the Bedouins
dried, and cut into thin shreds for flavoring their rice and
<i>asida</i> later on. When we started again in the afternoon
Senussi Bu Hassan said to me, “We will walk until we knock off the
young moon, and then we will be able to lunch at the well
to-morrow.” But when evening came clouds hid El Jadi before the
young moon had set, and we had to stop and make camp at 10:30 for
fear of losing our way.</p>

<p>SONS OF SHEIKH HERRI<br>
The <i>sheikh</i> was one of the kindliest and most hospitable
natives encountered by Hassanein Bey south of Kufra</p>
</div></div>

<p>In this part of the desert there was little to discover
externally, but a great deal to discover in oneself that could only
be brought to light in the silence and calm. It makes all the
difference in the world whether one goes through the journey with
the intention of getting back as quickly as possible to
civilization again, or whether one lives and enjoys every moment of
it.</p>

<p>Just as the sun was going down, I saw Zerwali sitting by
himself, drawing lines on the sand with a meditative finger. He was
doing the <i>yazerga</i>, or the “science of the sands,” with which
the Bedouin tells his own fortune. At intervals his eyes lifted
from the pattern before him and brooded dreamily on the vivid
colors of the sunset. The Bedouin has an appreciation of beauty and
a reverence for nature. How could he help it?</p>

<p>Day after day it is exactly the same. The photographs I took in
those seven days might be pictures of the same camp from different
angles, so persistently the same was the immense desolate expanse
of sand unmarked except for a camel’s skeleton or a few pebbles the
size of a walnut. There was nothing to distract one’s mind or
interrupt one’s contemplation.</p>

<p>What a peculiar charm this desolate desert has! What a cleansing
effect on one’s mind and body! How this constant touch with
infinity, day by day and night by night, affects the mind and the
spirit, and alters one’s conception of life!</p>

<p>How small and petty one’s efforts in the round of ordinary
civilization seem! How insignificant one’s efforts in this desert
actually are!</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p><em>Saturday, March 24.</em> We were up at 5:30 <span class=
"sc2">A. M.</span> tired, for we went to bed at 2. It was fine and
clear all day; a northeast breeze in the morning dropped at midday,
leaving it very warm. A strong northeast wind got up again at 10
<span class="sc2">P. M.</span></p>

<p>At 9:30 <span class="sc2">A. M.</span> the country began to
change slightly; the sand was softer and the ground a little
undulating. At 10 we came across patches of black broken stone,
which continued all day. At noon we sighted on our right the first
<i>hatab</i>—dried brushwood—of Zieghen Valley. At 1:45 we halted
for a hot meal and a rest near the first <i>hatab</i> we
reached.</p>

<p>Our fuel-supply was exhausted the previous day, and we had had
nothing hot to eat or drink since the morning of the day before. At
5:13 we sighted sand-dunes to the southeast, about 40 kilometers
distant. The dunes ran southward in a line toward Zieghen Valley.
At 8:30 the hillocks of <i>hatab</i> increased in number and
extent.</p>
</div>

<p>When we started in the morning we hoped to get to Zieghen that
day. Later there was disagreement as to why we had not reached it.
Bu Helega remarked that the guide must have gone too far to the
west or we should have arrived at the well before this. Zerwali,
who had selected Bu Hassan for our guide, came to his defense; it
was because we lost time slaughtering the camel and feasting the
day before that we did not arrive, he said. Hamad had another
explanation. “The camels are not being driven at all,” he said.
“One sleeps long and gets up at his leisure, and the camels are
still in sight.” (It was the custom of the men to drop out of line
for a nap of a half an hour or so, the slow pace of the camels and
their track in the sand making it possible for them to catch the
caravan easily on wakening.)</p>

<p>When we halted to make a fire and have the first hot meal in
thirty hours, I remembered that this was just where we had lost our
way on the previous trip to Kufra in 1921. After our meal, Dawood,
Zerwali’s uncle, left us with his single camel to go to Taiserbo,
which lay a day’s journey west of Zieghen. He proposed to get his
wife and daughter and take them to Cyrenaica, where there were
better prospects for business. Zerwali had agreed to help him in
his affairs in the new region. It must have taken a lot of pluck
for the old man to undertake the long journey to the north with the
two women and but a single camel. I asked him how he would manage
it. He told me that the first day they would all walk. The next
day, as the weight of water on the camel grew less, his daughter
would ride, and the third day his wife.</p>

<p>“But suppose something happens to your camel?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Protection comes from God,” was his quiet answer. I gave him
rice, macaroni, tea, and sugar, and when we had said the “Fat-ha”
he departed very happy.</p>

<p>The Bedouins were delighted with a great feast of rice and
camel-flesh and went to bed in vast contentment. It was a beautiful
night, and I left my tent and spent a few tranquil moments under
the golden moon and the stars paled by her brighter light. Their
serene cheerfulness and encouraging company sent me back to my bed,
as always, with new hope and confidence.</p>

<p>This is the entry in my diary for the following day:</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p><em>Sunday, March 25.</em> Start at 7:45 <span class="sc2">A.
M.</span>, halt at 1:45 <span class="sc2">P. M.</span> Make 24
kilometers. Highest temperature 32°, lowest 14°. Strong northeast
wind all last night and until 4:30 to-day. Cloudy all the morning,
no sun; a few drops of rain at midday. It clears in the afternoon.
We walk all the way among little hillocks of dry <i>hatab</i>
gradually increasing from a few inches to eight feet in height as
we near the well. The hillocks are interspersed with patches of
sand strewn with bits of black broken stone. The sand gets
gradually softer until it is moist a few inches under the
surface.</p>

<p>At 9:15 we sighted to the southwest about 3 kilometers away the
sand-dunes of El Washka, a small well of the Zieghen group. At 9:30
we passed on our left Matan Bu Houh, the old well of Zieghen. We
camped near the few date-trees that stand by the best well of the
group, El Harrash.</p>

<div>
<p>APPROACHING THE HILLS OF ARKENU<br>
The explorer’s caravan nearing the first oasis that he discovered
seven days’ journey south of Kufra. The photograph was taken in the
morning, and in the foreground is seen a ray of sunshine coming
from beyond the hills.</p>
</div></div>

<p>In the desert a well does not mean a nicely excavated and
stoned-up arrangement such as one finds in other parts of the
world, with a bucket and windlass or a pump. In this part of the
desert a well is a spot where the water is close to the surface and
can be easily obtained by digging. It is just a damp patch of sand
which the Bedouins scrape open with their hands, getting water at
three or four feet down. Between the visits of caravans the sands
drift over the place and choke the water-hole, so that each
newcomer must clean it out for himself. But the joy of an ample
supply of fresh water after days of having just enough for making
tea, with no chance of a bath or even a shave, is sufficient reward
for all the labor of digging out the well. If it has been a long
journey the first thing to think of is the camels. After they have
been watered and a good meal digested, washing is the most
important item in the program. If the water is scarce, clothes have
to wait until the next well, because the question of water for the
trek has to be considered.</p>

<p>As soon as the men have rested, sheepskins are filled and left
for the night. Early next morning two or three men go to see which
of the sheepskins has leaked and, if possible, detect the cause of
the leakage. They also make a point of separating the bad
sheepskins from the good ones, so that on the journey water should
be taken on the first day or two from those which leak or are
unreliable.</p>

<p>The first night at a well, however tired the caravan may be, is
always made the opportunity for great rejoicing, singing, and
dancing. Before arriving at the well one’s idea of a rest has been
at least four or five days’ stay and plenty of water to make up for
past privation. Thoughts dwell on the pleasing idea of really
having water to splash about with. Curiously enough, after a single
day’s rest, a fever of restlessness gets hold of one again, and the
luxury of abundance is left most eagerly for the privations of the
road. No matter if it be a big well surrounded by a fertile oasis,
full of the comforts of life, yet one returns with a sigh of
contentment to the twelve hours’ trek and the lunch of dried
dates.</p>

<p>The well, when scraped out, is probably about the size of a
tea-table for two. The moist sand holds the walls together. Usually
one leaves it alone a little for the sand to settle, but the water
is always sandy, and it is too much bother to strain it. Not on one
single occasion did I drink a glass of water that was not cloudy,
and never did I see the bottom of my zinc cup while drinking. The
filter which kind friends said I must take with me I never used at
all until we got to the Sudan, and there the water was really bad;
in an inhabited area you do not know what may have happened to it.
And then when we tried to get this famous filter working, we found
there were no washers for it, so that was the end of the story of
the filter.</p>

<p>Dirt in the desert, it may be necessary to remark, is quite
different from dirt anywhere else. It is not unwholesome, for the
sand is a clean thing, and the clothes of the Bedouins let in the
air. Vermin is there, but it is inevitable, and the Bedouin pays no
heed to it. I might have just had my bath, and then I would go and
sit down for a glass of tea with my men and—well, you are bound to
collect these things!</p>

<h2><a id="chap13"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class="sub_chapter">THE CHANGING DESERT AND A CORRECTED MAP</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p><em>Monday, March 26.</em> At El Harrash Well of the Zieghen
group. Highest temperature 27°, lowest 6°. Fine and clear with
northeast wind, which develops into a bad sand-storm at eleven. The
storm continues until 6:30 in the evening, and the wind does not go
down until two hours later.</p>
</div>

<p>Our halt at Zeighen should have been only for a night, but the
severe sand-storm kept us wind-bound for another day. Zieghen is
merely a group of four wells, the two that we passed on Sunday, El
Harrash, where we were camped, and another, Bu Zerraig, twenty
kilometers to the east.</p>

<p>During the day Bu Helega talked to Abdullahi about my coming to
the desert.</p>

<p>“You have audacity, you Egyptians,” he said. “For your bey to
come twice to our country, which no stranger has visited before in
my time, that is boldness. Why does he come here and leave all
God’s bounty back there in Egypt, if not for some secret purpose?
He comes to our unknown country to measure and map it, and, by God,
not once but twice.”</p>

<div class="figcenter iw1">
<a id="illus45"></a>
<br>
<img src="images/illus45.jpg" alt="">
<div>
<p>IN THE OPEN DESERT<br>
Study of shadows cast by the camels</p>
</div></div>

<p>Even my good friend Bu Helega was suspicious of my intentions in
penetrating into his country.</p>

<p>I finally discovered the real basis of the antagonism of those
who live in the desert to the coming of persons from the outside
world. It is not religious fanaticism; it is merely the instinct of
self-preservation. If a single stranger penetrated to Kufra, the
cherished center of the life of their tribe, it would be, as the
Bedouins say, “the camel’s nose inside the flap of the tent.” After
him would come others, and the final outcome would be foreign
domination. That would mean the loss of their independence and the
paying of taxes. They can hardly be blamed for dreading either of
those results.</p>

<p>The changes produced by time in the desert, which we are
accustomed to think of as eternally the same, are interesting. When
Rohlfs passed to the westward of Zieghen on his way to Kufra in
1879 he reported a broad stretch of green vegetation here. To-day
there is no extent of greenness, merely a great deal of
<i>hatab</i>, dead brushwood. Rohlfs’s statement, however, is
confirmed by Bu Helega, who says that when he was a child his
father used to take him to Kufra when he went to get dates, because
the Bedouins believe that the waters of Shekherra, the headquarters
of the Zwayas near Jalo, are bad for children in the summer. Bu
Helega used to be carried on his father’s back most of the way. It
was in those days that the trip was made in three days and five
nights, without halts. They gave the camels but one meal between
Jalo and Zieghen; when they reached the latter place the beasts
were fed on the green stuff that was growing there then. What has
seemed like an error on Rohlfs’s part in describing so much
vegetation at Zieghen is thus demonstrated to be merely the result
of a difference in conditions after forty-five years. It is
probably a variation in the water conditions in the soil which has
turned the living shrubs into fire-wood.</p>

<p>Our trek from Buttafal to Zieghen illustrated the uncertainties
of desert travel. In spite of all the precautions that we could
possibly think of, our fuel ran out, one camel died, and two others
were so exhausted that they were to fail us soon. The food for the
camels was used up also, and from Zieghen to Kufra they were fed on
date-tree leaves, gathered at the former place, which was very poor
food for them indeed.</p>

<p>I picked up from a Bedouin a proverb with a cynical slant to it:
“Your friend is like your female camel; one day she gives you milk,
and the next she fails you.”</p>

<p>On the two evenings at Zieghen I took observations of Polaris
with the theodolite. When the observations were worked out I found
that Zieghen was about a hundred kilometers farther to the
east-northeast than Rohlfs had placed it. He did not visit the
place and therefore could make no observations on the spot but
relied on what he was told by the Bedouins. I found also that
Zieghen is 310 meters above sea-level.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p><em>Tuesday, March 27.</em> Start at 8:15 <span class="sc2">A.
M.</span>, halt at 8 <span class="sc2">P. M.</span> Make 47
kilometers. Highest temperature 26°, lowest 8°. Fine and clear,
cold strong northeast wind all day and all night. A few white
clouds. From El Harrash Well the guide points out the direction of
Kufra as being five degrees south of southeast. For two hours we
walk among <i>hatab</i>, which extends about 10 kilometers
southeast of the well. Then we enter a region of soft sand, a
little undulating. The undulations gradually increase until we get
into the sand-dune country late in the afternoon.</p>
</div>

<p>At 2:30 we sighted a range of sand-dunes to the east, with a few
black stone <i>garas</i> or small hills in between them. They were
about twenty or thirty kilometers away and marched off to the
southeast as far as we could see. Later there were
<i>gherds</i>—sand-dunes—to the southwest as well, and at 5:30 the
<i>gherds</i> closed in across our track and we definitely entered
them. So far, however, they were not high or difficult to
cross.</p>

<p>The complete separation between the Bedouins and the Tebus on
the march impressed me again. The blacks say that they do not like
the Zwayas and fear them. The Tebu camels were well kept and better
behaved than those of the Bedouins. Each Tebu camel had a lead-rope
and did not run loose as the others did.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we passed the landmark of Jebail El Fadeel. As
with most desert landmarks, its name commemorates some one who lost
his life there.</p>

<p>El Fadeel was one of the best guides in the desert. He was going
toward Kufra from Jalo with a caravan. Sand-storms of great
severity swept down upon them. While there is no direct evidence of
what happened, the testimony of what was finally found told the
story eloquently. Fadeel’s eyes must have been badly affected by
the driving sand. He bandaged them and, thus deprived of sight, had
those who were with him describe the landmarks as they reached
them. Nevertheless they missed the wells of Zieghen and tried to
struggle on direct to Kufra. The desert took them in its relentless
grip, and of the entire caravan but one camel survived. The beast
struggled on to its home at Kufra, led by its infallible instinct.
There it was recognized by the markings on its neck as belonging to
El Fadeel. A rescue party followed the camel’s track back into the
desert, but its help came too late. The bodies of the men lay stiff
upon the sand, near the landmark now known by El Fadeel’s name, the
bandage on the old guide’s eyes revealing the tragic truth.</p>

<p>THE HILLS OF ARKENU<br>
The first oasis that the explorer discovered on his way from Kufra
to the Sudan; the camp can be easily discerned</p>
</div></div>

<div class="excerpt">
<p><em>Wednesday, March 28.</em> There were heavy clouds all day,
with little sunshine. It was cloudy too in the evening. A cold
northeast wind developed at 8 <span class="sc2">A. M.</span> into a
sand-storm lasting for three hours and a half. The cold wind
continued on into the evening. A few drops of rain fell at 10:30
<span class="sc2">P. M.</span></p>
</div>

<p>We walked among sand-dunes for two hours, when we entered
undulating country, covered with broken black stone. It was bad
going for the camels. An hour later the black stone belt ended and
we came into the sand-dunes again.</p>

<p>At 11:30 in the forenoon the chain of the Hawayesh Hills were on
our left and sand-dunes and black stone <i>garas</i> on our right.
At 12:15 we passed on our left four kilometers away Goor El Makhzan
landmark, hills of black stone ranging from fifty to one hundred
and fifty meters in height. At 1:45 we passed the landmark of El
Gara Wobentaha, which means “the <i>gara</i> and its daughter,” two
sugar-loaf hills of appropriate proportions to suit the
designation.</p>

<p>I talked with some of the Bedouins about our losing our way in
1921. They showed no surprise. To these desert dwellers it is all a
part of the day’s work, losing one’s way, one’s camels, one’s
water, or one’s fuel.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p><em>Thursday, March 29.</em> The lowest temperature this day was
not recorded, as the minimum thermometer was broken in the
storm.</p>
</div>

<p>The Hawayesh Hills were on our left until mid-afternoon. At
11:30 we entered soft and very undulating sand-dunes, difficult
going for men and camels. At 1:30 we passed Garet El Sherif to the
right, the biggest landmark we had yet seen. It was a ridge-shaped
<i>gara</i>, one hundred and fifty meters long and about one
hundred meters high, with three smaller ones beside it, two to the
south and one to the north. At three we got into heavy dunes again
and two hours later passed into flat country, with harder sand and
patches of black stone. At 3:30 in the morning the worst sand-storm
we had encountered began. It swept the tents from the moorings, and
mine collapsed on top of me, smashing a few of my instruments and
also the small chronometer.</p>

<p>With the whole tent on top of me, weighted down with the
constantly growing load of sand, I was threatened with suffocation,
but fortunately I got hold of a tent-peg, with which I held the
canvas away from my face. Some of the men tried to come to my
assistance, but I shouted to them to put the sacks of flour and
pieces of luggage on their tents and mine to keep them down. I lay
in my uncomfortable position under the tent for two hours or so.
The sand came hurtling through the gap in the tent like shot from a
gun. The men and the camels suffered badly. Had the pole of my tent
fallen a fraction of an inch to one side, it would have smashed my
big chronometer, and then what a difference it would have made to
the scientific results of the expedition!</p>

<p>To the outside world the work of an explorer is either failure
or success with a distinct line between them. To the explorer
himself that line is very hazy. He may have won his way through,
amassed all the information that he sought, be within a score of
miles of his journey’s end; then, suddenly, his camels give out. He
must abandon the best part of his luggage. Water and food take
precedence; the boxes containing his scientific instruments, his
records, have to be left behind. Maybe his plight is still worse,
and he must sacrifice everything, even his own life. To the outside
world he would be a failure; generous critics might even call him a
glorious failure, but in any case he has failed. Yet how much is
that failure akin to success! Sometimes on those long treks the man
who fails has done more, has endured more hardships, than the man
who succeeds. An explorer’s sympathy is rather with the man who has
struggled and failed than with the man who succeeds, for only the
explorer knows how the man who failed fought to preserve the fruits
of his work.</p>

<p>The Bedouins understood this. There is a trait in their
character that surprised, even astounded me sometimes, until I grew
to understand it. There was often no hilarity, no rejoicing when
the day’s march came to its appointed end. “To-day we have arrived,
but to-morrow—” they seem to say. Because you have succeeded to-day
it is nothing to brag about. It was not by your skill; it was
destiny. To-morrow you may start an easier journey and fail
horribly. On my first long trip in the Libyan Desert in 1921,
between the oases of Buseima (one of the Kufra group) and Kufra, a
three days’ journey, we came across the remnants of a perished
caravan. There was a hand still sticking out of the sands, the skin
yellow like parchment. As we passed, one of the men went reverently
and hid it with sand. A three days’ trip, and yet those men had
lost their way and died of thirst.</p>

</div></div>

<p>There are many gruesome tales of the remnants of a caravan
perishing within sight of the well. So far from being deterred from
taking the same route, the Bedouin only says that it was God’s
decree that they should die on the road. “Better the entrails of a
bird than the darkness of the tomb,” one Bedouin told me, meaning
that he preferred to be eaten by vultures.</p>

<p>It was a very tiring day, what with the disturbance to our rest
during the night and the heavy going through the soft dunes. But
the men were cheerful because we were getting near to Kufra. The
news that Bu Helega, who lived at Hawari, the first halting-place
on the outskirts of Kufra, was going to slaughter a sheep and
provide a feast was an added incentive.</p>

<p>The camels were weak and thin, but three of them whose home is
in Kufra led the way all day without being driven, in spite of the
difficult walking over the dunes.</p>

<p>At 6:45 we sighted Garet El Hawaria, the great landmark that
indicates the approach to Kufra.</p>

<p><em>Friday, March 30.</em> We started at 7:45 <span class=
"sc2">A. M.</span>, halted at 5:45 <span class="sc2">P. M.</span>,
made thirty-five kilometers, and arrived at Hawari. A few drops of
rain fell in the late evening. The ground was flat, soft sand,
undulating a trifle, and marked with patches of black and red
stone. At 9:30 we entered upon the zone of red sand of Kufra. We
came across pieces of petrified wood all day. At 1:15 we passed
Garet El Hawaria, and at 3:30 sighted the date-trees of Hawari. An
hour and a half later we entered the oasis and soon camped at
Awadel.</p>

<p>We had arrived at the first outpost of Kufra. This name was
given in Rohlfs’s time to the four somewhat widely separated oases
of Taiserbo, Buseima, Ribiana, and Kebabo—Rohlfs’s designation for
the present-day Kufra—but now it is restricted to the last
named.</p>

<p>Hawari is the northernmost part of the present Kufra, a
comparatively small oasis with the three villages of Hawari,
Hawawira, and Awadel. Seventeen kilometers south lies El Taj, the
seat of local government and the principal settlement. It is
situated on a rocky cliff overlooking the depression of the oasis
proper, which lies to the south and contains the villages of Jof,
Boema, Buma, El Zurruk, El Talalib, and El Tollab.</p>

<p>I had intended to go straight on to El Taj, the chief town of
Kufra, the next day, but Bu Helega claimed the right of hospitality
and insisted that I should stop a day at the oasis which is his
home. After a good night’s rest—undisturbed by sand-storms or
collapsing of tents—and a shave, I was quite ready to do full
justice to the breakfast sent by the Bedouins of a caravan which
had just arrived from Wadai. At the same time I gathered some
interesting information which made me consider making a change in
my plans.</p>

<p>I sent a messenger on to El Taj with letters to Sayed El Abid,
the cousin of Sayed Idris and the chief Senussi in Kufra, and to
Jeddawi, Sayed Idris’s personal <i>wakil</i>.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Zerwali escorted me to Hawari, where I was
received at the <i>zawia</i> by the <i>ikhwan</i> and the notables
of the town. After the usual words of welcome and exchange of
compliments, I went to dinner at the house of Zerwali’s uncle. The
Bedouin chiefs protested that I should not have come direct to
Hawari but should have camped outside to give them an opportunity
for a ceremonial reception. They had apparently heard how I was
received at Jalo and would have liked to duplicate it for me here.
I heard rumors of intrigues among some of the Zwaya chiefs, who
were suspicious of my purpose in coming a second time to Kufra and,
as a protest, had refused to attend the dinner. They were
influential chiefs, and the news made me determined to press on to
El Taj before they could send word there in prejudice of my
coming.</p>

<p>After the meal I rode home through the beautiful moonlight and
on my arrival found a difficult task before me. Egaila, Bu Helega’s
eldest son, had been bitten by a scorpion. With more confidence in
my medicine-chest than I had myself, Bu Helega asked that I should
cure him. I took the anti-scorpion serum and went to the house,
where I found the boy very ill indeed, burning with fever.</p>

<p>At the last moment before leaving Cairo these serums had been
included in my equipment, and a doctor friend, while he was shaking
my hand and I was saying good-by to people all around me, explained
to me (perhaps most lucidly) just how to employ the serums. It was
the first time I had ever attempted that kind of injection, and I
tried to conjure up the scene and recall fragments of those parting
instructions, but it only struck me how different was that dimly
lit room with the anxious friends and relatives watching my every
movement from the hearty send-off when the serum had been added to
my stock in trade.</p>

<p>However, in spite of my doubts whether the case was not too far
advanced for treatment, I administered the serum and went to my
camp wondering what the outcome would be.</p>

<p>Before long I heard a crowd approaching my tent with loud
outcries which sounded hostile to my ears. Probably, I thought, the
boy was already dead, and his death would be laid at my door
instead of at that of the scorpion.</p>

<p>VALLEY OF ERDI</p>

<p class="justify">While there remained many miles of travel for
the expedition, after this valley was reached the long waterless
desert treks were at an end. The march to El Obeid was by easy
stages through fertile country from village to village.</p>

<div>
<p>DESERT BREAKING INTO ROCK COUNTRY SOUTH OF OUENAT</p>
</div></div>

<p>I summoned my men to protect the box of instruments, which I
suspected would be the first object of attack, and prepared myself
for a hostile approach. It was a disturbing moment.</p>

<p>But great was my relief when I detected in the cries of those
who were coming a note rather of rejoicing than of hostility.
Presently Bu Helega entered my tent and thanked me with impressive
warmth for the relief which I had given his son.</p>

<p>“It was like magic,” he declared with fervor, “Allah is great.
That medicine of yours has made the boy well again.”</p>

<p>In appropriate terms I answered, “Recovery comes from God.”
Already the fever was abating and the boy evidently on his way to
recovery. I thanked God internally for the good fortune which had
attended my ministrations. If the boy had died, my position would
have been a dangerous one. When my visitors had left, I went out
into the moonlight for a walk among the graceful palms.</p>

<h2><a id="chap14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<p class="sub_chapter">KUFRA: OLD FRIENDS AND A CHANGE OF PLAN</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p><em>Sunday, April 1.</em> We started at 9:45 <span class=
"sc2">A. M.</span> and halted at 2 <span class="sc2">P. M.</span>,
making 17 kilometers, and arrived at El Taj. At 11:15 we entered a
broken rocky country, very rolling, covered with patches of black
and red sandstone until we reached Taj.</p>
</div>

<p>Egaila came to help in loading the camels. He had quite
recovered from his scorpion-bite and was to go with us to Taj.
Breakfast was sent by Bu Helega for me and my men. When I protested
that he should not have taken the trouble, he retorted that I
should have given him an opportunity to provide the customary three
days’ hospitality. A little later a slave-girl came from him with a
huge bowl of rice, chicken, and eggs.</p>

<p>She was evidently dressed especially for the occasion and was
quite charming in her dainty attire of blue cloth with a red sash
about her slim waist.</p>

<p>I told her that we were starting at once and should not need the
food.</p>

<p>“You may need it on the way,” she replied shyly. “I cooked it
myself.”</p>

<p>“If that is the case,” I assured her, “I will accept it gladly.”
She was obviously pleased and immediately went back for another
bowl quite as large and inviting. I bowed to the inevitable and
sent my thanks to her master.</p>

<p>We were given a pleasant send-off by the people of Awadel, and I
set out at the head of my caravan on Bu Helega’s horse. We needed
no guide just now, for I knew the way myself.</p>

<p>“Aye, the bey knows the way too well,” said Senussi Bu Hassan.
“He will soon become a guide in this country of ours.”</p>

<p>The approach to Kufra from the north has an element of surprise
in it that makes it doubly interesting. We marched through a gently
rolling country with an irregular ridge of no great height forming
the horizon ahead of us. Suddenly the top of the ridge resolved
itself into the outlines of a group of buildings, their walls hard
to distinguish at any distance from the rocks and sands they match
so well in color and in form. This was El Taj, the headquarters of
the Senussi family in Kufra. As we entered the town, we saw that
the ground dropped abruptly away beyond it, down to the valley of
Kufra. This pleasant valley is a shallow, roughly shaped oval bowl,
forty kilometers in extent on its long diameter and twenty
kilometers on the short one. It is dotted with palm-trees, and
across it in an irregular line from northeast to southwest are
strung the six settlements of Boema, Buma, Jof, Zurruk, Talalib,
and Tollab. Close to Jof lie the blue shimmering waters of a
fair-sized lake. At this mid-point in the sand-waste of the desert
this expanse of water is both a boon and an aggravation. The mere
sight of so much water brings refreshment to the eyes weary of
looking at nothing but sand; but to the parched throat it is worse
than a mirage to the vision, for its waters are salt.</p>

<p>On our entry into Taj I was met cordially by old friends. Sayed
El Abid, the cousin of Sayed Idris and the chief Senussi in Kufra,
was ill with rheumatism, but Sidi Saleh El Baskari, the
<i>kaimakam</i>, Sidi Mahmoud El Jeddawi, Sayed Idris’s
<i>wakil</i>, and several <i>ikhwan</i> brought words of welcome
from him and conducted me to the house of Sayed Idris where I was
to stay. It was here that we had lived on the first trip to Kufra
two years before, and immediately I felt at home.</p>

<p>“You will have to initiate your men into the ways of Kufra,”
said El Baskari whimsically. “Even Zerwali has not been here for
thirteen years.”</p>

<p>At once the hospitality began, with coffee brought by the
commandant of the troops. I had just time for a short rest before a
slave came to take me to the house of Sayed El Abid for a meal. Led
by the same messenger that came for us two years ago, I walked
through the same streets, and entered the same wonderful house of
the Senussi leader with a curious feeling as though time had stood
still or gone back. El Abid’s house is a labyrinth of corridors,
lined with doors behind which live the members of his family and
his retainers. We passed into the familiar room whose spaces seemed
more richly adorned than ever with gorgeous rugs, many-colored
cushions, and stiffly embroidered brocades. On the walls hang the
well-remembered collection of clocks, barometers, and thermometers
in which my host takes naïve delight. The clocks, of which there
are at least a dozen of assorted shapes and sizes, were all going
strong.</p>

<div class="figcenter iw1">
<a id="illus51"></a>

<div>
<p>THE DESERT FROM THE HILLS OF OUENAT<br>
Ouenat is the bigger of the two oases which the explorer
discovered. In the foreground is the explorer’s tent and camp. The
hills are of granite and are about fifteen hundred feet high.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Sidi Saleh came to bear me company and to apologize for the
enforced absence of my host, Sayed El Abid. There was set before me
a feast fit for the gods, or for mortals fresh from the monotonous
living of the desert: lamb, rice, vegetables, <i>mulukhiah</i>, an
Egyptian vegetable rather like spinach, delicious bread, sweet
vinegar, milk, sweets, followed by coffee, milk with almond pulp
beaten up in it, and finally the ceremonial three glasses of tea,
flavored with amber, rose-water, and mint.</p>

<p>When the meal was over and I had returned to my house, I had
barely time to see about the disposition of my baggage and discuss
the question of camels for the next stage of the journey when the
slave came to conduct me again to El Abid’s house for dinner. El
Baskari was again my host, a dignified, kindly figure in a
beautiful <i>gibba</i> of yellow and gold, having changed the
classical soft Bedouin <i>tarbush</i>, which he had been wearing,
for a white silk <i>kufia</i> and a green and gold <i>egal</i>.</p>

<p>When this second meal had reached the point of scented tea and
incense, suddenly the clocks began to strike, each with its own
particular tone, the Arabic hour of three—which then meant nine by
the standard of the outside world. I closed my eyes for a moment
and felt myself back in Oxford with the hour striking in endless
variety of tones from all the church towers of the university
town.</p>

<p>I went out into the moonlight with the fragrance of the
rose-water and the incense lingering about me. I stood on the edge
of the ridge overlooking the waters of the lake and reflected on my
former visit to Kufra when this was my goal. Now it was the
beginning of the most interesting part of my journey. I heard the
voices of <i>ikhwan</i> and students reading the “Hesb” in the
evening quiet. Abdullahi slipped out of the shadows and stood
beside me.</p>

<p>“This is the night of half-Shaban” (meaning the middle of the
month before Ramadan), he said in a low tone as of a man who thinks
aloud. “God will grant the wishes of one who prays to-night.”</p>

<p>For several minutes we two stood there silently. My face was
toward the southeast, where lay an untrodden track and oases that
are “lost.” But Abdullahi turned to the northeast, where lies Egypt
and his family and children. I did not need to ask him for what he
prayed.</p>

<p><em>Monday, April 2.</em> At Hawari I had been told by the
Bedouin caravan from Wadai that a French patrol had come north as
far as the well at Sarra over the main trade-route from Wadai to
Kufra. This was the route I had intended at first to follow, but it
seemed that only the small portion of it which lay between Sarra
and Kufra remained unexplored. Again I had heard vague stories of
the “lost” oases on the direct route south which I had planned some
time to explore, although I knew that this direct route to Darfur
in the Sudan was practically never used either by Bedouins or by
Sudanese because of its supposed difficulties and dangers. The
story of the French patrol turned my mind again to these oases, and
I determined to try and find them rather than to follow my original
plan.</p>

<p>I set out decided to do all that was possible to explore these
lost oases, but, failing that, I was to cross the Libyan Desert by
the beaten road through Wajunga and Wadai and then turn eastward
toward Darfur.</p>

<p>Zerwali and Suliman Bu Matari, a rich Zwaya merchant, came to
discuss the trip southward. Bu Matari had discouraging counsel to
offer as to the route I had now decided to take.</p>

<p>“Eight years ago,” he said, “the last caravan to go that way—of
which my brother Mohammed was the leader—was eaten up and
slaughtered on the frontier of Darfur. They went, not as you wish
to go, but by the easier route from Ouenat to Merega”—a small oasis
about 290 kilometers southeast of Ouenat. “This journey you propose
to make is through territory where no Bedouin has passed before.
The <i>daffa</i> [a long waterless trek] between Ouenat and Erdi is
a long and hazardous one. God be merciful to the caravan in such
heat. Your camels will drop like birds before the hot south winds.
Even if you get through safely, who knows how the inhabitants of
the hills over there will receive you? Do not let your anxiety to
travel fast overrule your wisdom and keep you from choosing the
safe trade-route to Wajanga and Abeshe.”</p>

<p>I thanked him for his advice; but I knew that I should not take
it.</p>

<p>THE KING OF OUENAT<br>
He is holding his Mohammedan rosary in his hand</p>
</div></div>

<p>After luncheon royally provided by El Abid, I went to visit his
son Sharrufa. He is an intelligent young man, thirsting for
knowledge. He has gone as far into the outside world as Benghazi
and that by no means metropolitan community is still for him “the”
city of the world. He apologized for the illness of his father, and
I offered to send medicine which might possibly help him.</p>

<p><em>Tuesday, April 3.</em> It was very warm, with heavy clouds
and a bad southwest wind. After luncheon as usual I went to visit
Shams El Din, a cousin of Sharrufa, and his younger brother. The
older boy is very intelligent and has eyes that seem to be asking
questions of the world. They offered me three cups of milk with
almond pulp and home-made jam. I knew that to refuse such an offer
is to offend; so I left the house in a state of torpor. Dinner
later at Sayed El Abid’s did not improve matters internally.</p>

<p>Again I discussed the plan of going by way of Arkenu and Ouenat.
I was more determined than ever. We would see what Bu Helega had to
say when he arrived from Hawari.</p>

<p><em>Wednesday, April 4.</em> I was awakened by Jeddawi, who as
usual brought me a pot of fragrant tea.</p>

<p>This is comparative civilization, I thought, as I saw Ahmed
preparing my shaving-kit. There are of course times when one
welcomes the conveniences and comforts of civilization, but having
trekked so far one feels more at home when on the move than when
resting in an oasis.</p>

<p>The early part of the day was spent in cutting down most of the
wooden boxes and rearranging the luggage in preparation for the
long trip south. It required particular care, since from now onward
there would be no chance of changing the camels until our arrival
at El Fasher in the Sudan, about 950 miles.</p>

<p>The question of providing new shoes for the men of my caravan
had to be attended to, as the Bedouin shoes that were made for them
at Jalo had been worn out. Before lunch I had a visit from a few
Zwaya chiefs, who came officially to pay their respects, and also
unofficially to satisfy their curiosity and suspicion as to the
size of my caravan and the equipment I was carrying, and if
possible to find out what plans I had made for my journey to the
Sudan.</p>

<p>Lunch, as usual, at Sayed El Abid’s. I had the cheerful news
that the medicine I gave to him had a good effect. The afternoon I
spent in attending to the question of arms and ammunition. Later I
took a long walk in order to make compass observations of the
vicinity of Taj.</p>

<p><em>Thursday, April 5.</em> Zerwali had a long talk with Bu
Helega, who arrived in the night from Hawari. The latter refused
point-blank to go to El Fasher by the Ouenat route.</p>

<p>Bu Helega came to visit me and tried to persuade me to go by way
of Wadai. When he saw that his advice would probably not be taken
he became desperate. I had clearly pointed out to him that nothing
could change my decision to cut across by the Ouenat route to El
Fasher.</p>

<p>“By God, it’s a dangerous route,” he said, “and many a caravan
has been eaten up by the inhabitants of the hills on the way. They
do not fear God, and they are under the authority of no man. They
are like birds; they live on the tops of mountains, and you will
have trouble with them.”</p>

<p>“We are men, and we are believers,” I responded. “Our fate is in
the hands of God. If our death is decreed, it may come on the
beaten track to the nearest well.”</p>

<p>“Many a Zwaya beard has been buried in those unknown parts,” he
declared. “The people are treacherous, and they fear neither God
nor man.”</p>

<p>“May God’s mercy fall on those Zwayas who have lost their
lives,” I replied. “Our lives are no more precious than theirs.
Shall our courage be less?”</p>

<p>“The water on this route is scarce and bad,” he argued again.
“God has said, ‘Do not throw yourselves with your own hands unto
destruction.’”</p>

<p>“God will quench the thirst of the true believer,” I answered,
“and will protect those who have faith in Him.”</p>

<p>He felt himself in danger of being beaten in argument and
shifted his ground.</p>

<p>“None of my men are willing to accompany you on this route,” he
asserted, “and I cannot send my camels either. It is sending them
to death. If you find anybody who is willing to hire his camels I
am ready to pay for them, but neither my men nor my camels are
going to take you on this journey.”</p>

<p>“Do what you like,” I retorted with spirit. “I am going by this
route. It will be between you and Sayed Idris when he knows that Bu
Helega has not kept his word.”</p>

<p>There the argument rested. I had already learned that the few
owners of camels at Kufra had been urged by Bu Helega and his men
not to help me in my new plan. He hoped by so doing to force me to
accept his plan of the safe route through Wadai.</p>

<p>An enormous lunch was provided by Jeddawi. The three days of
official hospitality of El Abid having ended yesterday, Jeddawi, as
Idris’s <i>wakil</i> at Kufra, can now entertain us.</p>

<p>Bu Helega was about to leave, but I invited him to partake of
our meal, and he accepted. He hoped still to persuade me to change
my mind. I hoped even more strongly to convince the old man that
the route was not as dangerous as he made it out to be. After the
third glass of tea we parted, neither of us having succeeded in
convincing the other. But I felt that my last words had an effect
on him.</p>

</div></div>

<p>In the afternoon the slave came to tell me that his master,
Sayed El Abid, would like to see me. I had already intimated that
he need not be in a hurry to give me an audience, as I knew he was
suffering badly from his gout and it was very difficult for him to
come down to the reception-room. But he was not willing to have me
think that he had violated the rules of hospitality by delaying the
audience, and so he very kindly allowed me to see him in spite of
his suffering.</p>

<p>It was the first time that I had seen Sayed El Abid on this
journey, and as I was ushered into his presence I thought that he
might have come out of a gorgeous illustration of “The Thousand and
One Nights.” He was dressed in a yellow silk <i>kuftan</i>
embroidered with red braid, a rich white silk <i>burnoos</i>
carelessly hung on his shoulders. On his head he wore a white
turban with snow-white gauze flowing from the sides. This is the
classical head-gear of the chiefs of the Senussi family. He carried
in his hand a heavy ebony stick with a massive silver head. He was
a picture of simple and benign dignity, and no one would have
suspected him of being the redoubtable warrior that he really is.
He was sitting on a big upholstered arm-chair, and as I entered he
tried to get up. I hastened to him, grasping his hand, and begged
him not to make an effort to rise. He was suffering badly from his
gout, and the conversation started easily on the subject of his
ailment. He has been suffering for many years. At times at night,
he said, when the pain is at its worst, “I pray to God that He may
shorten the number of my days in this world, for I cannot even
perform my prayers as I should.”</p>

<p>We then discussed the question of my trip to the Sudan, and he
too, I found, had been prevailed upon to urge me to take the safer
route through Wadai. I pointed out to him that Sayed Idris was now
in Egypt and that I had to hasten to my country to try to repay a
little of the hospitality that had been lavished upon me by the
Senussis. It was fortunate that the route to the Sudan through
Ouenat is known to be shorter than that through Wadai.</p>

<p>“You are a dear friend of ours,” he said; “and the Sayed, I am
sure, would rather have you arrive in Egypt late and safe than hear
that any harm had befallen you.”</p>

<p>“Our fates are in the hands of God,” I replied; “our efforts are
decreed by Him, and I carry with me the blessing of the Senussi
masters.”</p>

<p>I spoke with an air of determination. Sayed El Abid was pensive
for a few moments. Slowly he raised his head and lifted his two
hands toward heaven.</p>

<p>“May God make your efforts succeed and send you back safe to
your people,” he said, yielding to my desire. “You have visited the
tomb of our grandfather at Jaghbub and the <i>kubba</i> of Sidi El
Mahdi here, and you have their blessings. ‘He who struggles and has
faith is rewarded by God.’” He quoted from the Koran. We then read
the “Fat-ha”; he gave me his blessing and again prayed that God
might guide our steps and give me and my men fortitude. I felt very
happy as I wound my way through the multitude of corridors and
courtyards. I was relieved to know that I had an ally in Sayed El
Abid, and that he would not prove an obstacle in my new plan of
going to the Sudan by way of Ouenat.</p>

<p>All the men of my caravan were there when I entered the house.
One look at their faces told me with what suppressed excitement
they had been waiting since my departure to Sayed El Abid to hear
his verdict on the journey south. Slowly I made my way to my room
and asked them to come in. I too had to suppress my excitement; but
mine was the excitement of success and not of expectation. There
was a long pause before I could control my voice and make it as
indifferent as it should be.</p>

<p>“The Sayed has blessed our journey to Ouenat and has given me
the ‘Fat-ha’ for it.”</p>

<p>I dared not even look in the men’s faces.</p>

<p>“We have the blessings of the Senussi masters with us, Sayed El
Abid has assured me, and God will give us fortitude and success;
and guidance comes from Him.”</p>

<h2><a id="chap15"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<p class="sub_chapter">KUFRA: ITS PLACE ON THE MAP</p>

<p><em>Friday, April 6.</em> The day began with the arrival of an
immense bowl of roses, gloriously fragrant, sent by Sayed El Abid.
This is the way the desert belies its name every now and then. I
defy the Riviera to produce anything finer than these, or more
fragrant.</p>

<p>It was Friday, the Moslem Sabbath, and I attended prayers at the
mosque. The young Senussi princes were expected, and some of the
Bedouins came in their best clothes, but side by side with the
richest of silk <i>kuftans</i> were the shabbiest <i>jerds</i>.
Every one took off his slippers as they came in. I watched them for
a while. There came a prosperous Zwaya or Majbari merchant with the
crease still fresh in rich robes just removed from the chest, and
<i>kohl</i> in his eyes, put in with a <i>madwid</i> (<i>kohl</i>
stick) of ivory or brass. The prosperous man, maybe, has everything
upon him new, and he smells strongly of scent, perhaps pure
rose-water distilled in Kufra, or else musk or other strong perfume
from the Sudan. He enters in a dignified way and takes his place.
There comes another, and his <i>jerd</i> is tattered and his face
bronzed and withered, not flabby, but he is no less dignified.
Clothes play but a small part in this assembly because of the
natural dignity and courage of these people, and those qualities
are brought out in relief even more by the tattered <i>jerd</i>
than by the fine silks and scents, which sometimes take away
something of the personality of the individual.</p>

<p>A slave comes. He is the favorite slave and confidant of one of
the Senussi chiefs. His silks are as rich and even more vivid, and
there is little to suggest servility. He feels his importance and
walks with equally dignified grace through the ranks of the
worshipers to take his place, maybe next to a dignitary, maybe next
to a beggar. At the mosque the poor not only stand on level ground
with the rich and the prosperous, but in a subtle way they have
their revenge, for in the house of God the master is God and the
beggar may feel as great or greater than the rich man since he is
not submerged in the luxury of the world and forgetting God. The
old and shabby <i>jerd</i> is, to the Bedouin going into the
mosque, as fit a garment for worship as silken brocades are proper
raiment for a man going to see the Senussi chiefs.</p>

<p>The worshipers are now ready. The <i>muezzin</i> has finished
the call to prayer. There is a hush. The young Senussi princes are
entering the mosque. They take the places that have been reserved
for them. All eyes turn toward them, and, on account of their
youth, they look a little shy and embarrassed. No one rises as they
enter, for this is the House of God, wherein God alone is the
master. Then the <i>imam</i> mounts the pulpit and delivers his
sermon. On the few occasions that I have been able to attend Friday
prayers in an oasis mosque, the theme of the sermon has often been
the same, advising the congregation to shun the world and its
luxury and to prepare for a life of happiness in the next world by
doing good. “Beware of the ornaments and the luxuries of this
world, for they are very enticing. Once you fall a victim to them
you lose your soul and stray farther from God. Draw nearer to God
by doing good deeds and obeying his commands. This life will pass
away. Only the next world is everlasting. Prepare yourselves for
it, that you may be happy in eternity.”</p>

<p>The interior of this mosque is beautiful in the simple dignity
of its lines. The walls are bare, whitewashed, scrupulously clean.
The floor is covered with rugs or with fiber matting. The
worshipers squat cross-legged upon the floor in a very reverent
attitude. There are perhaps two hundred of them, ranged in rows,
all facing toward Mecca. There are some who count their prayers
upon rosaries of amber beads; others, too poor to have rosaries,
record the number of their prayers by opening and closing their
fingers. There are some whose every movement betrays opulence and
prosperity; others, Bedouins of the desert, have a far-away look.
The most striking impression is the serenity and contentment
written on their faces. Even upon the pinched and haggard face
there is an expression of equanimity which shows that the man has
accepted his fate. It is written there that he is living on the
verge of starvation, yet he does not rebel.</p>

<p>After lunch at El Abid’s, Soliman Bu Matari came again to talk
about the trip south. He reported that Bu Helega and Mohammed, who
was to be our guide, had met and talked things over, but Bu Helega
was still unwilling to go.</p>

<p>Abdullahi had spent the day at Jof, gathering what information
he could about the Ouenat route and trying to find out if the Tebus
would let me hire camels from them for the journey thither.</p>

<p>After dinner at El Abid’s, I spent some time in Sayed Idris’s
library, which he had instructed Jeddawi to throw open to me.</p>

<p>Imagine a room of medium size filled with chests containing
books. The ceiling is decorated in vivid colors, the work of an
artist, a lover of the Senussis, who came from Tunis simply to do
them a service, just as in medieval Europe painters and sculptors
devoted their lives to adorning churches. Every bit of wood in the
room has come from Egypt or Benghazi. There is a window open to the
air with only wooden shutters as a protection against the sun.</p>

<p>THE MOST IMPORTANT DISCOVERY MADE AT OUENAT</p>

<p class="justify">Rock drawings found in the valley chiseled on
the granite rock. The drawings are similar to those found in Egypt
of prehistoric age. There are drawings of giraffes, gazelles of
every kind, lions, ostriches, cattle, but none of the camel, yet no
traveler can reach this oasis now except with the camel because of
the absence of water on the route and of any grains which could
make the journey possible for a donkey or a horse. The remains of
routes found in the Egyptian oasis west of the Nile Valley point
toward the oasis of Ouenat, and it is probable that in the old
times the route from the Mediterranean coast to central Africa was
through this oasis and not through Kufra, as is the case now.</p>
</div></div>

<p>It is not easy to move about, for books and chests of books are
ranged along the walls and in the middle of the room as well.</p>

<p>There are many very ancient chests used as cup-boards and at the
same time fitted with attachments at the sides which enable them to
be straightway loaded upon a camel in case of need. The library is
somewhat out of order, books piled carelessly one on top of
another, for Sayed Idris has long been absent. There is a great
number of manuscripts inclosed in beautifully tooled morocco
covers. There are modern books printed in Cairo and in India. There
are manuscripts from Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia. With the exception
of a few books in the Persian language, all are in Arabic. There
are two or three manuscripts of the Koran illuminated in gold. It
was a great privilege for me to be allowed to go into this library,
for as a rule no one is admitted.</p>

<p>I found many manuscripts laboriously written on ancient
parchment, works on philosophy, the Arabic language, theology,
Sufism, a few on poetry and mysticism, another on talismans and
magic. Many were the interesting and pleasant hours that I spent
among the collection. The surroundings and the atmosphere were just
right; so remote, so many miles from the world, one felt in the
mood to absorb the thought to be found in these manuscripts. Sit in
a comfortable chair in the midst of civilization and try to read
such books; one ring of the telephone would be enough to make them
appear archaic.</p>

<p><em>Saturday, April 7.</em> A fine pair of shoes came as a
present from Sharrufa. The chiefs of the Zwayas came to pay me
another visit. We talked over our coffee about Zwaya history. I
learned that it was not the Zwayas who first conquered Kufra from
the Tebus, but the Ghawasi and Jahama tribes. The names of two of
the Kufra villages, Tollab and Zurruk, are family names of the
Jahama tribe.</p>

<p>I gave each of my visitors a photograph of the group which I had
taken several days before, and they were delighted with them.</p>

<p>I realized to the full that day the perils of Kufra. Rohlfs
almost lost his life here by violence; I almost lost mine by
kindness. I lunched prodigally at El Abid’s, as usual, and the meal
was followed by coffee, three glasses of tea, with amber,
rose-water, and mint, and three glasses of milk enriched with
almond pulp. Then Sharrufa insisted that I should come to his house
and offered me three glasses of perfumed tea, followed again by
three glasses of almond-flavored milk. I reflected that to refuse
was to offend, and gulped down the beverages, which, by now, had
become somewhat nauseating. The end was not yet. Shams El Din
hauled me off to his house and set before me biscuits and nuts and
a huge glass of sweet syrup. It was almost more than flesh and
blood could endure, but—to refuse was to offend. There followed
three glasses of coffee, but I stalked forth with all the dignity
of a man going to the gallows or the Spartan boy with the fox
gnawing at his vitals.</p>

<p>As I lay down in my room to recuperate, many thoughts surged
through my brain. Would that the Bedouin, whoever he was, who
selected “three” as the mystic number to characterize desert
hospitality, had died unborn! But it was lucky that he did not hit
on seven instead of three. I came to the desert perfectly prepared
for destruction by the hand of nature or hostile men, but the idea
of perishing through indigestion did not commend itself to my sense
of the fitness of things.</p>

<p>And yet, at the proper time, I went to El Abid’s again for
dinner. Some of the Bedouin chiefs were my fellow-guests, and once
more the route to the southward was discussed. Bu Helega persisted
in his refusal to go by way of Ouenat.</p>

<p>“The conditions laid down by Sayed Idris,” he said, “call for a
journey to Wadai and not to Darfur.” He would send neither his
camels nor his men that way. I argued like a lawyer that since he
had contracted to provide thirty-five <i>marhalas</i>—or days’
journeys—from Kufra southward, it should make no difference to him
whether I use those <i>marhalas</i> to go to Wadai or to El Fasher
or back to Egypt. He was unconvinced by this ingenious reasoning,
but when he realized that I was determined, that El Abid was not
opposed to my plan, and that I was willing to take fewer camels
than originally stipulated, he gave a reluctant consent. But he
would not go himself or send his men.</p>

<p><em>Sunday, April 8.</em> The affair of Bu Helega’s horse came
to a head. I bought him for thirty-three pounds. He was sturdy and
a splendid traveler, needing to drink only every second day.</p>

<p>After luncheon I took El Abid’s photograph and had a long talk
with him about his malady, which he bore with true Bedouin
fortitude, about conditions in Cyrenaica and Egypt, and about my
plans for the trip to the Sudan.</p>

<p>I had had bad luck with my scientific work at Kufra. I did not
find it easy to escape surveillance and to move about unattended or
to use my instruments without arousing suspicion. What was worse,
it had been cloudy every day since I arrived there, and I had been
unable to take observations of the sun or Polaris with the
theodolite.</p>

<p>WHITE SAND VALLEY AND EXPLORER’S CAMP<br>
A view of the inhabitants of Ouenat, the second oasis discovered by
the explorer</p>
</div></div>

<p>After dinner I was thoroughly tired. I had used up all the
indigestion tablets which I brought with me. I felt that it would
be a relief to get back to the simplicity of the open desert
again.</p>

<p><em>Monday, April 9,</em> was still cloudy, but a cool breeze
was blowing. I spent a quiet day, reading in Idris’s library,
developing a few films, and buying <i>girbas</i> and barley for the
journey. Sayed El Abid gave me copies, written with his own hand,
of letters by El Mahdi to various <i>ikhwan</i>. He made me
presents of a Moorish knife in a silver scabbard and a flint-lock
pistol also beautifully inlaid.</p>

<p><em>Tuesday, April 10.</em> The clouds cleared away in the
afternoon, and I took photographs of the valley. I arranged with
the shoemaker for shoes for myself and my men, and for bandoliers,
which the men insisted on having, in view of the alarming rumors
they had been hearing.</p>

<p>I met Mohammed Sukkar, who was to be our guide over the Ouenat
route, for the first time, and liked him.</p>

<p><em>Wednesday, April 11.</em> El Abid had heard of my purchase
of Bu Helega’s horse and sent me a Tuareg sword and an Italian
carbine, to carry when I ride him.</p>

<p>At last I was able to make observations with my theodolite. I
was anxious to see how my results would agree with those of
Rohlfs.</p>

<p><em>Thursday, April 12.</em> I sent Sayed El Abid my shot-gun as
a gift.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I rode with Sayed Mohammed Bu Tamanya and
Zerwali to Jof. We were met by the chiefs of the village. I visited
the <i>suk</i>, where the weekly market was being held, the
<i>zawia</i>, which is the oldest Senussi school in Kufra, and the
mosque. Jof is the trade-center of Kufra. It was interesting to
find side by side in the <i>suk</i> rifle-cartridges whose marking
showed them to be thirty years old, Italian tomato sauce in tins
from Benghazi, blue and white calico made in Manchester and
imported from Egypt, and leather, ivory, and ostrich-feathers from
Wadai. These products of the south, however, are not plentiful now
in Kufra, except when a merchant who has brought them from Wadai is
prevented for some reason from going on to the north to sell them
in Egypt or Cyrenaica. Kufra had seen its best days as a
trade-center before the occupation of the Sudan. Then it was easier
to find an outlet for the products of Wadai and Darfur through
Kufra than by way of the country to the east. Even now, however,
there is a contraband trade through Kufra in female ivory and ivory
of less than fourteen pounds weight, the exportation of which is
prohibited by the Sudan Government.</p>

<p>In addition to the trade that passes through Kufra, most of the
big Zwaya chiefs who have enough slaves go in for agriculture. They
raise barley and maize. The Senussis are more progressive and grow
melons, grapes, bananas, marrows, and other vegetables of the more
delicate kinds, all of which are a great treat after the monotonous
fare of the desert. They raise mint and roses, from which they make
the rose-water and mint essence so essential in their ceremonies of
hospitality. From a few olive-trees some olive-oil is produced in
primitive presses. The animals of Kufra are camels, sheep, donkeys,
and a few horses. Meat, however, is very expensive, as there is
little grazing for sheep in the valley. The animals are fed on
pounded date-stones, which do very well as a staple diet. But some
green stuff is necessary at intervals. The Senussis, who are in
everything more progressive than their neighbors, raise chickens
and pigeons.</p>

<p>The price of slaves, I learned at Kufra, has risen a great deal
during the last few years because there are no more slaves coming
up from Wadai on account of the vigilance of the French authorities
in that province. Occasionally the Bedouins get round this by
contracting a marriage with a slave-girl in Wadai and then, when
they come back, divorcing and selling her. On one of my travels in
1916 I was offered a slave-girl for six gold louis (120 francs);
now the price varies from thirty to forty pounds. A male slave
costs less. The Bedouins sometimes marry their slave-girls, and if
one of these bears a male child she automatically becomes free. The
Bedouins have no prejudice against color; that is, if a slave bears
the head of a tribe his eldest male child, that child ipso facto
becomes in his turn the head of the tribe, however black he may be.
Whereas the children of slaves are slaves, the child of a
slave-girl and a free man, however poor, is always free, and even
though his father dies and he is left an orphan, he can never be a
slave. The lot of a favorite male slave especially is preferable.
They have more power and are taken more into the confidence of
their masters than free men. They are very well treated and become
members of the family. They are well dressed, for an ill-dressed
slave reflects badly on his master, just as a shabby footman would
detract from the glory of a millionaire’s Rolls-Royce. The favorite
slave of Sayed Idris, Ali Kaja, is not only the most trusted man of
Sayed Idris, but he has more power and authority among the Bedouins
themselves than many a free man. Such a slave is treated as a
confidant. If the slave of Sayed El Abid came to me with a message,
I took it to be absolutely true, knowing that it is his duty to
report exactly what he is told. In the same way, if I wished
something to reach the ears of Sayed El Abid, and only his ears, I
knew that I could tell it without a moment’s hesitation to his
slave and be perfectly confident that it would not go anywhere
else.</p>

<div>
<p>THE CARAVAN ARRIVING AT OUENAT</p>
</div></div>

<p>A man slave is permitted to buy a slave-girl. Once when I asked
Ali Kaja about the price of slaves, he complained: “They are very
expensive nowadays. The other day I bought one, and she cost me
forty pounds in golden sovereigns.” He said it with such an air
that he might never have been a slave himself.</p>

<p>The shabbiest slave that you see in an oasis is generally the
freed slave, who curiously enough is looked down upon by the other
owned slaves, and himself feels ashamed that he is a freed slave
and belongs to no one!</p>

<p>There are many date-trees all through the Kufra Valley, and many
of them belong to the Senussis. When the Zwayas invited Sidi Ibn
Ali El Senussi to come to Kufra, each one of them gave the Senussis
one third of his property, land, and date-trees. The proportion of
two to one between the date-trees owned by the Zwayas and those of
the Senussis has, however, in the years since then, been
considerably altered in favor of the Zwayas. These regular
inhabitants of the valley naturally planted new trees faster and
thus increased their own holdings. One can still see in the valley
the walls separating the Senussi lands from those of the
Zwayas.</p>

<p>On our way back from Jof we met a wedding party. The officer
commanding the troops at Kufra was being married, and the father of
the bride invited me to “empty gunpowder” in honor of the occasion.
I was glad to pay a compliment to the officer, who was an old
friend of mine, and, when they fired their guns in salute, in good
Bedouin style I rode my horse at a gallop up to the party, pulled
him to a sudden halt in front of the bride, and fired my gun into
the ground before her. It was astonishing how Baraka, the moment he
heard the sound of the guns, took to the gallop and brought me at a
rush within the prescribed distance for firing. It was all a part
of his training.</p>

<p><em>Friday, April 13.</em> A slave of Sayed Idris came to be
treated for an illness which had lasted for two months. It seemed
to be a digestive upset, with continual vomiting. I gave him ether
on a piece of sugar, milk, and rice, and by evening he was
better.</p>

<p>Bu Helega arrived from Hawari with seventeen camels. I told him
to complete the twenty-five we had agreed upon.</p>

<p>I received a visit from the bridegroom and his father-in-law,
who came to thank me for the compliment I paid the wedding
procession.</p>

<p><em>Saturday, April 14.</em> Bu Helega brought the rest of the
camels. He was in a dilemma about sending a man with us. He did not
wish to send his son, or even a slave, on such a hazardous journey
which none of us might get through alive. On the other hand, there
was the off chance that Fate might be good to us and let us escape.
In that case, remote though it seemed to him, if he had no
representative with us, how should he get his camels back, or
rather their value? For it would be the natural thing to sell them
at the end of the trip.</p>

<p>The afternoon was spent in packing and the evening in making
observations. The weather was now more gracious. This was only the
third night since reaching this spot that I had been able to see
Polaris. I determined that I would not leave Kufra until I had made
at least twice as many observations on different nights.</p>

<p><em>Sunday, April 15.</em> The morning was spent in loading. Bu
Helega was still in a quandary about sending a man with us. But
since I had the camels it did not make any particular difference to
me what he decided.</p>

<p>The slave whom I had been treating was astonishingly improved in
health. He came to thank me. No one was more surprised than I at
what I had been able to do for him.</p>

<p>At two the caravan set out for Ezeila, the last well of Kufra
Valley on the south. There we were going to do <i>tag-heez</i>
properly, taking several days for perfecting our final
preparations. I had bought two sheep for Bu Zafar, as none of us
had made this journey before.</p>

<p>All my men had been newly clothed and made a cheerful sight, in
spotless white with red shoes. Their carefully cleaned rifles
glittered as they hung on their backs. Most of the new camels
looked fresh and strong.</p>

<p><em>Monday, April 16.</em> Abdullahi took the horse to Taj for
shoeing, as I found that the stony ground was too hard for him. I
sent a brass tray to the commandant as a wedding present, and the
last three bottles of Bovril to Idris’ sick slave. Our departure
was postponed because the guide was still occupied before the
<i>kadi</i> with a legal matter over a camel.</p>

<p><em>Tuesday, April 17.</em> I had breakfast at Soliman Bu
Matari’s in Jof with Zerwali, Abdullahi, the commandant, Saleh, and
Mohammed Bu Tamania. The rest poked fun at the commandant because,
being a new bridegroom, he would not partake of a dish cooked with
onions. “They do not forgive when they are young,” said Bu Tamania,
winking at the commandant.</p>

<p>THE VALLEY OF ERDI<br>

</div></div>

<p>I bought a <i>hejin</i>, or trotting-camel, for my own use,
paying nine pounds for it. We were at last ready for the start the
next day.</p>

<p>As I made my last observation of Polaris, I had a strong hope
that I should have succeeded in putting Kufra into its proper place
on the map. I had been keen to check Rohlfs’s determination of the
position of Kufra, which he made from the observations of his
companion Stecker at Boema. Taj had not been built in Rohlfs’s day.
When I made my first observations at Taj, I discovered that they
were not in agreement with the results of Stecker’s observations at
Boema, which is two kilometers from Taj in a direction 54° east of
true south. I thereupon determined that I would not leave Kufra
until I had secured a sufficient number of observations to preclude
the possibility of any appreciable error. Polaris was observed with
the theodolite by me on six different nights, under conditions
which Dr. Ball, in his scholarly paper on my work published at the
end of this volume, declares to leave no room for an error greater
than a single minute of latitude or longitude.</p>

<p>The net result of my observations, when they were finally
reduced after my return to Egypt, was that Kufra is some forty
kilometers south-southeast of the position assigned to it by Rohlfs
from Stecker’s observations. I found the altitude of Kufra to be
almost precisely the same as that ascertained by Rohlfs, 400 meters
for Boema, on the floor of the valley, and 475 meters for Taj on
the valley’s ridge.</p>

<h2><a id="chap16"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<p class="sub_chapter">THE LOST OASES: ARKENU</p>

<p><em>Wednesday, April 18.</em> Bu Helega had at last found two
men, Bukara and Hamid, who would go with his camels. They were poor
men, and the money they would make loomed larger in their eyes than
the danger.</p>

<p>Sayed El Abid sent three representatives to see us off. They
brought a letter of farewell from him that touched my heart.</p>

<p>Bu Helega came to say good-by. At the final moment there were
tears in his eyes, and I do not think they were caused by fears for
his camels or for the men whom he was sending with us. In spite of
our controversy over the route, we remained true friends, with
affection and respect for each other.</p>

<p>My men were greeted by their friends as though this was to be
their last meeting. It was the most touching farewell of the whole
journey. “May God make safety your companion. . . . What is decreed
is decreed, and that will happen. May God guide you to the true
road and protect you from evil.”</p>

<p>There was little about this parting of that sense of assurance
which attends both those who go and those who stay behind when it
is a case of starting for a holiday with some certitude of safe
arrival. There were a few quivers in the last phrases of farewell,
and, knowing what had passed in the preceding days and the
intimidation to which the men had been subjected, I could guess
what was in their minds. Whereas I was excited by thoughts of the
“lost oases” and taking the unexplored road and going into the
unknown, they were thinking that this might be the last time they
would shake hands with their friends. There was even a pitying look
on the faces of some of those who came to bid us God-speed as to
doomed men, yet being Bedouins they also felt, “It is decreed that
they should go thus.”</p>

<p>We recited the “Fat-ha,” the first chapter of the Koran:</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>Praise be to God, the Master of the Universe, the Merciful, the
Compassionate, the Lord of the day of Resurrection. It is You Whom
we worship, and it is You Whom we ask for help. Guide us to the
straight path, the path of those whom You have rewarded, not those
upon whom displeasure has fallen nor those who have gone astray.
Amen.</p>

<p>THE FIRST TREE SEEN APPROACHING ERDI</p>
</div></div>

<p>There followed the call to prayers:</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p>God is great, and I testify that there is no God but God, and
that Mohammed is the Prophet of God. Haste to prayers, haste to
that which is beneficent. Prayers are ready. God is great. There is
no God but God.</p>
</div>

<p>It was upon the edge of the valley of Kufra, where the oasis
ends and the desert stretches out ahead. They had walked with us
until then, and as we passed from the valley into the flat desert
we looked back upon the date-palms. The sun was setting, dusk
falling, and Kufra itself in the waning light was glimpsed as
through the aperture of a camera. Those who had come to say
farewell straightway returned and looked back no more. I was eager
to get away from Kufra and let my men turn their minds to the task
ahead.</p>

<p>At last the real start had been made. Before me all was unknown,
full of the mystery and the fascination that lie in those parts of
the earth’s surface yet untraversed by men from the outside
world.</p>

<p>We started at 4:30 <span class="sc2">P. M.</span> and halted at
8:15, making fifteen kilometers. It was fine and clear, with no
wind. Hard sand covered with very fine gravel, slightly undulating.
After leaving the date-trees of Ezeila and Kufra, we crossed a zone
of <i>hatab</i>, similar to that at Zieghen, and entered the
<i>serira</i> at 5:45. At 6:30 we passed hillocks which form the
south side of the valley of Kufra. At 8:15 we arrived at Hatiet El
Houesh, marked by dry <i>hatab</i>, which must once have been
green. We left two men behind us to bring two loads that were to be

<p>Our caravan comprised twenty-seven camels and nineteen persons:
myself, Zerwali, Abdullahi, Ahmed, Hamad, Ismail, Senussi Bu
Hassan, Senussi Bu Jaber, Hamad Zwai, Sad the Aujili, Faraj the
slave, Bukara and his young brother Hamid, the camelman, Hassan,

<p>An entry from my diary again:</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p><em>Thursday, April 19.</em> Start at 1:45 <span class="sc2">P.
M.</span>, halt at 7:15 <span class="sc2">P. M.</span> Make 24
kilometers. Highest temperature 32°, lowest 11°. Fair and clear,
with few white clouds. Southeast breeze which drops at midday.
After leaving Hatiet El Houesh we enter into a <i>serira</i> again,
flat expanse of hard sand covered with fine gravel. East of the
<i>hatia</i> is a chain of sand hillocks covered with dark brown
stones; to the west is another similar chain about 4 kilometers
away.</p>

<p>At 2:15 we pass the end of the Hatiet El Houesh. The
<i>hatia</i> is about 2 kilometers broad. At 3:45 there is a
<i>gara</i> on our left about 2 kilometers away, and at 5 another
<i>gara</i> 4 kilometers distant on our right. At 6:30 the sand is
softer, with patches of red and black stones. The surface is
undulating.</p>
</div>

<p>We were delayed in starting through waiting for the two camels
which had been left behind, and used the time in collecting
<i>hatab</i>. It was very warm, and the camels grew tired quickly
because of the heat. The country was similar to that between
Buttafal and Zieghen. With my new <i>hejin</i> I found it easy to
fall behind to take observations without exciting suspicion. We had
to camp early because of the condition of the camels.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p><em>Friday, April 20.</em> Start at 2 <span class="sc2">A.
M.</span>, halt at 9:30 <span class="sc2">A. M.</span> Start again
at 3:30 <span class="sc2">P. M.</span> and final halt at 8
<span class="sc2">P. M.</span>, make 48 kilometers. Highest
temperature 32°, lowest 10° at 12:30 <span class="sc2">A. M.</span>
Fine and clear, with cold southeast wind in the early morning. It
drops at midday and gets up again at 4. In the evening it shifts to
northeast.</p>

<p>At 4 <span class="sc2">A. M.</span> passing through undulating
country strewn with stone. At 6 enter <i>serira</i> again, flatter.
Sunrise is at 5:30. Immediately thereafter on our right and left
are low sand-hills from 8 to 10 kilometers distant. See a swallow
in the morning and a hawk in the afternoon. At 4:20 cross low
sand-dunes and sight a black <i>gara</i>, a long low mound, 10
degrees south of southeast.</p>
</div>

<p>This was the worst part of the journey for traveling, so far as
temperature conditions were concerned. In the middle of the day it
was too hot to march, and at night it was too cold. So we broke the
trek into two parts, starting soon after midnight, and resting in
the heat of the day. We had trouble with the baggage because of the
difficulty of good packing and loading in the dark. The camels,
however, went better on this day.</p>

<p>This was the fourth day of the lunar month. The Bedouins observe
the weather conditions on that day, believing that the weather for
the rest of the month will be the same. It was to prove true in
this case.</p>

<p><em>Saturday, April 21.</em> We started at 2:30 <span class=
"sc2">A. M.</span> At six in the morning we came across stony and
hilly country, which lasted for 12 kilometers. We passed on our
left the <i>gara</i> called Garet Kudi. At nine we entered again
into <i>serira</i>, with distant sand-dunes on the right and
left.</p>

<p>One camel fell ill shortly after our start and refused to go
even when its load was taken off. Two Bedouins were left behind to
bleed it, but all efforts at cure were in vain, and it had to be
slaughtered. I forbade the Bedouins to eat its flesh. Later, after
the midday halt, two Tebus dumped the loads from their camels and
went back to dry the flesh and leave it until their return from
Ouenat. They were to catch us later. This all delayed us about an
hour.</p>

<p>The men had little sleep the previous night and were very tired
after sunrise. But it was chiefly the intense heat from noon to
four o’clock that exhausted both men and camels. It was a very
tired caravan that started again at 4.30 <span class="sc2">P.
M.</span> and moved slowly along.</p>

very difficult for the camels’ pads, which were often cut by the
sharp stones</p>
</div></div>

<p>I saw two hawks and fresh sleeping-camps of birds on the
sands.</p>

<p><em>Sunday, April 22.</em> We traveled over flat hard sand, with
occasional sand hillocks, three to ten meters high, covered with
black stones. At 5:30 <span class="sc2">A. M.</span> we sighted a
chain of hills on our left running from north to southwest across
our path. At 8 <span class="sc2">A. M.</span> we entered into
broken, hilly country, which continued all day. It was called Wadi
El Maraheeg. We came across broken ostrich-eggs.</p>

<p>We had better loading to-day, but the men were tired. Many of
them fell out to snatch a half-hour’s sleep, catching up with the
caravan when they woke.</p>

<p>Bukara brought me two little eagles, which he had taken from
their nest on the top of a <i>gara</i>. I ordered him to put them
back and saw that it was done.</p>

<p>The <i>hejin</i> was ill and had to go all the afternoon without
load or even saddle.</p>

<p>At the midday halt the men fell asleep immediately and snored
heavily. This kind of travel is grueling, tedious work. But we were
getting on.</p>

<p><em>Monday, April 23.</em> We started at 2.30 <span class=
"sc2">A. M.</span>, halted at 9:15 <span class="sc2">A. M.</span>,
second start at 3:45 <span class="sc2">P. M.</span>, halt at 9
<span class="sc2">P. M.</span>, making forty-six kilometers. This
was the most exhausting trek that I had yet known. For eight days
we had had only four hours of sleep a day. We had hardly started
before the men with one accord fell back to snatch a half-hour’s
sleep, leaving the camels to follow the will-o’-the-wisp of the
guide's lantern. I could not avail myself of this privilege,
because of my anxiety for my instruments. The loading, done in the
dark, was insecure, and a slipped fastening may mean a broken
instrument or camera.</p>

<p>At intervals one or another camel would halt and kneel and
refuse to get up. Then a Tebu would come and press his thumb on a
certain big vein in the camel’s forehead and manipulate it. It
seemed to give the beast relief.</p>

<p>We were having a hard time of it crossing the high steep
sand-dunes when suddenly mountains rose before us like medieval
castles half hidden in the mist. A few minutes later the sun was on
them, turning the cold gray into warm rose and pink.</p>

<p>I let the caravan go on, and for half an hour I sat on the
sand-dune and let the sight of these legendary mountains do its
will with my mind and heart. I had found what I came to seek. These
were the mountains of Arkenu.</p>

<p>It was the outstanding moment of the whole journey. Any
hardships I might have endured, any hardships that might still
await me, were as nothing compared with the joy that filled me at
the mere sight of these hills. It was not like going to seek a
hidden treasure that had to be dug out of the ground. There they
were standing right up high before me so that I might feast my eyes
upon them. Up and down, up and down we had plodded across the
sand-dunes in the chilly grayness of the hours before dawn, until
suddenly at the last dune it was as though somebody had rung up a
curtain upon these magical hills of which I have not seen the like
in the whole Libyan Desert. From the time I left Sollum until I
reached this spot, there had been nothing like the mountains of
Arkenu. The sight of them so gripped me that for a while I dreamed
that I was not in the desert any more.</p>

<p><em>Tuesday, April 24,</em> was the one hundred and eleventh day
from Sollum and the one hundred and fortieth from Cairo. We covered
broken country, sand covered with stones, undulating. At 5
<span class="sc2">A. M.</span> heavy sand-dunes. After the dunes
the country became stony again, and later there was hard sand
covered with gravel. North of Arkenu Mountain and only a hundred
meters from it was a big sandstone hill about two kilometers long
and a hundred meters or so high.</p>

<p>There was a glorious sunrise, with shades of red and gold
splashed on the few gray clouds in the east. The cool wind soon
dropped, and it became close and warm.</p>

<p>Arkenu Mountain is a mass of granite, its gray surface weathered
to a ruddy brown, rising uniformly along its length some five
hundred meters from the desert surface. It is made up of a series
of conical masses which run together at their feet, without
intervals between them. We approached it at its most western point.
As we came toward it, we could not tell how far it extended to the
east. At the farthest point which we could see in that direction it
rose into a peak. We marched around the northwestern corner of the
mountain mass and came to the entrance of a valley which runs to
the eastward. There is one solitary tree of the species called by
the Goran <i>arkenu</i> standing in the desert here. From it the
oasis takes its name. We made our camp near it. This was a bad spot
for camel-ticks, who lived in the shade of the tree and came
literally running by the score when our camels approached. We were
obliged to camp some distance from the tree, as the insects did not
seem to care to forsake its shade, even to attack the camels.</p>

<p>I once picked up a tick that was like a piece of petrified
stone. I hit it with a stick, and it just clicked like a piece of
stone. I turned away and pretended to be busy with something else.
It took about three or four minutes before it gave any sign of
life. The tick knows instinctively that safety lies in pretending
to be petrified. Then, without warning, it scooted like lightning.
When there are no camels these ticks live on nothing. They absorb
the camel’s blood, get inflated, and then they can live—the
Bedouins say years, but certainly a few months.</p>

</div>

<p>Immediately on our arrival the camels were sent into the valley
to be watered and to bring back the supply of water of which we
were much in need.</p>

<p>Two hours after we pitched camp the two Tebus left behind
arrived with a supply of meat from the slaughtered camel, which was
eaten with enthusiasm for dinner. A hot, gusty wind blew all the
afternoon. While I was resting in my tent I was suddenly aroused by
something tickling my ear and tried to brush it away, without
discovering what it was. In a moment a gust of wind blew in one of
the side walls of the tent, which had been raised for ventilation,
and I felt something darting across my body. I grasped at it
instinctively and, fortunately for my peace of mind, missed it. It
was a snake some four feet long, which was subsequently caught by
my men and despatched.</p>

<p>The men held a shooting competition in the afternoon. It started
as a perfunctory affair, but the interest quickened when I put up a
Medjidie—a Turkish dollar—as a prize. Senussi Bu Jaber, though
short-sighted, won the contest. Hamid expressed the feelings of the
other contestants when he said: “It was the Medjidie that worked on
my emotions and made me nervous. I had hit the mark before.”</p>

<p>I made observations and took photographs, and, incidentally,
treated the guide’s teeth.</p>

<p>Goran, the black tribes of the neighborhood, suddenly appeared
from the valley and were kept to dine with my men. No one had
dreamed of their presence until they appeared. The mountain looked
desolate and deserted, and one would not suspect that inside it
lies a fertile valley which is inhabited. As a matter of fact,
Arkenu is not inhabited all the year round. In the valley is good
vegetation to which in the past Bedouins, Tebus, and Goran brought
their camels during the grazing season. They closed the entrances
to the valley with rocks and left the camels there unattended for
three months.</p>

<p>“When they came to take them back,” said Mohammed, the guide,
“they had as much fat on them as this.” He put his closed fists one
on top of the other.</p>

<p><em>Wednesday, April 25.</em> The Goran family in the valley
brought a sheep, milk and <i>samn</i>, which is butter in a curious
liquid state because of the heat, as <i>diafa</i> or hospitality.
They also drove their sheep to the camp to be milked for the men of
the caravan.</p>

<p>After luncheon I rode into Arkenu Valley with Zerwali and
Bukara. It is a <i>karkur</i>, or narrow winding valley, extending
some fifteen kilometers back into the mountains. There are grass,
shrubs, and an occasional tree. We visited the Goran hut, where I
took photographs of a girl and two boys of the family. The boys
wore white robes, the sign of the sons of a <i>sheikh</i>. When I
got back to camp, I sent presents of cloth, handkerchiefs, and rice
for the three children.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful moonlight night. I decided to spend three
days more at Arkenu because the grazing was good and the camels
still seemed tired from their hard trek. My <i>hejin</i> was doing
well. I picked up stones for geological specimens and aroused the
suspicions of some of my men. They thought there was gold in what
stones I picked up or else I would not take the trouble to carry
them back home.</p>

<p><em>Thursday, April 26.</em> At Arkenu. Highest temperature 36°;
lowest 9°. Fine and clear, with very strong and hot southeast wind.
Twice the wind blew the tents down. We sent the camels to be
watered and to graze. It was a sweltering day, over 100° Fahrenheit
in the tent, and only a little less in the shade outside. Making
observations was difficult on account of the wind. I did not like
to shelter myself behind the tent while making them for fear of
arousing the inevitable curiosity and suspicion. The wind dropped
in the evening, and we were repaid for a hot and scorching day by a
beautifully cool evening with a fine moon. There was dancing and
singing by Bukara and the other men until midnight.</p>

<p><em>Friday, April 27.</em> Arkenu was the first of the two
“lost” oases which it is my good fortune to place definitely on the
map. There had long been a tradition that two oases existed close
to the southwestern corner of Egypt. But the position that they had
been conjecturally given on one or two maps was from thirty to one
hundred and eighty kilometers out of place. No one had described
them from an actual visit. My observations showed that Arkenu is
situated in north latitude 20° 12′ 32″ and east longitude 24° 44′
15″ and has an altitude of 598 meters at the foot of the mountain.
It is thus well within the boundaries of Egypt.</p>

<p>The principal interest of this oasis, as of Ouenat, lies in the
possibilities it offers for exploring the southwest corner of
Egypt, which has until now been unreached either by military
patrols or by travelers. No one has known with any certainty of
water-supplies in that part of the desert which could be relied
upon. The water at Arkenu is apparently unfailing and is drinkable,
though not as wholesome for human beings as one could wish. Arkenu
may conceivably prove to have strategic value at some future time,
standing as it does almost precisely at the meeting-point of the
western and southern boundaries of Egypt.</p>

</div>

<p>Both Arkenu and Ouenat differ from all the other oases of the
Western Desert of Egypt in that they are not depressions in the
desert with underground water-supplies, but mountain areas where
rain-water collects in natural basins in the rocks.</p>

<p>The mountain chain of Arkenu as I saw it is about fifteen
kilometers in extent from north to south and some twenty kilometers
from east to west. But there was no opportunity to explore it to
the eastward, so that I cannot say whether it may not extend
farther in that direction than I have stated. I could only observe
it as far as I could see from the desert at the western foot of the
mountain. It may well be that off to the east Arkenu Mountain runs
into a chain of hills of which the Ouenat Mountains are also spurs
to the south. There is an opportunity for more exploration of the
eastern portions of both these rock masses than I was able to make
in the time and with the resources at my command.</p>

<p>The nearest known point to Arkenu and Ouenat to the east or
rather the northeast is Dakhla Oasis, some six hundred kilometers
distant. There is a tradition that there is an old track to Egypt
between these two points, but a journey from Dakhla to Arkenu and
Ouenat with caravan, which would take at least fourteen days, would
be a formidable undertaking.</p>

<h2><a id="chap17"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<p class="sub_chapter">THE LOST OASES: OUENAT</p>

<p><em>Saturday, April 28.</em> We started at 9:30 <span class=
"sc2">P. M.</span> for the first all-night trek, halting at 7
<span class="sc2">A. M.</span> of the twenty-ninth. We made forty
kilometers. It was fair and clear with a very strong hot wind from
southeast all day. The wind blew from the same quarter, but was
warm rather than hot all night. The ground was <i>serira</i>, with
large stones making bad going for the camels. At 6 <span class=
"sc2">A. M.</span> we reached the western corner of Ouenat Mountain
and camped an hour later.</p>

<p>The day was spent quietly, chiefly in rest for the coming night
trek. In the early evening we sent men to bring the camels from
their grazing. Bukara hired a camel from a Tebu, to relieve his
own, which he wanted to be able to sell at the end of the journey
for a high price. I hired three Tebus and their camels to go with
us, but not for the same reason. Our transport was inadequate, for
the trek from Kufra had shown me that our loads were too heavy. The
camels became quickly exhausted.</p>

<p>The camels were brought in at eight in the evening, and we
started an hour and a half later. They were lightly loaded this
time because we were taking no water from Arkenu. The water there,
while its taste is not particularly unpleasant, is hard on one’s
digestive apparatus. We had three bad cases of dysentery among the
men. The invalids rode camels from the start, and the rest of the
men took turns during the night.</p>

<p>The caravan started out in the best of humor. At intervals some
cheerful spirit stopped and began to chant. In a moment half a
dozen of them were lined up beside him, all chanting, stamping and
clapping their hands rhythmically as the camels filed past. The
words of the song were always the same:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent0">En kán azeéz alaih lanzár</div>

<div class="verse indent0">Hátta laú ba-éd biddár</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The accents are strongly pronounced and differ in the two lines,
as I have marked them. I would translate the verse thus, without
making any attempt to fit it to the jazz rhythm that would be
needed to complete the effect for the western ear: “O beloved, our
eyes gaze after you, even though your camp is far away</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>Again and again the chant was repeated until the performance
ended in a sudden shout. I had been the whole audience for the
little show, beating the rhythm with my whip, and when the shout
went up I called out, “Farraghu barud!” “Empty gunpowder!” was the
signal for a <i>feu de joie</i> from the rifles, after which we all
took our places in the caravan and went on exhilarated.</p>

<p>A night march has its advantages. The time, unless one is dead
tired, passes more quickly than during the day, and the stars are
cheering company for any lover of nature. On the horizon ahead of
us loomed the dark masses of the Ouenat Mountains. It is so much
easier to march with one’s destination distinct before one than to
be walking on the flat disk of a desert where every point of the
compass looks like every other and the horizon keeps always at the
same maddening distance. We steadily approached the mountains until
the sun was rising over them, tinting and gilding their peaks and
throwing out on the desert a heavy shadow whose edge marched
steadily toward the mountain-foot as we approached it from another
direction. Shortly after sunrise we were opposite the northwest
corner of the mountains, and an hour later we made camp close under
their rocky walls. At this point there was an indentation in the
mountain-side, with a well in a cave at its inner end. We pitched
our tents at the mouth of this little arm of the desert sea, and
ten minutes later we were all sunk into sleep. This was our first
full night of travel, and we had some arrears of sleep to make
up.</p>

<p>However, we did not sleep as long as we had expected to, but
roused ourselves before noon and turned our attention to food. The
French saying, <i>qui dort dîne</i>, may be true under some
conditions, but we of the desert find it more satisfactory when we
are able to do both. We all found pleasant distraction in roasting
parts of the lamb which was provided by Mohammed as <i>diafa</i>
for Ouenat.</p>

<p>I spent the rest of the day in visiting the well, which is
situated in the cave in the mountain-side, in taking observations,
and in looking over our surroundings. At this point the mountain
rises in a sheer cliff, with a mass of boulders, great and small,
heaped against it at its foot. The stones that make up this
<i>tabre</i>, as the geologists call it, have been carved by ages
of wind and driven sand into smooth, rounded shapes that giants of
the heroic days might have used in their slings to kill monsters or
for some enormous game of bowls. The <i>ain</i> or well lies a few
meters away from the camp, in a cavity walled and roofed with the
great rocks. It is a pool of refreshing water kept cool by their
protection from the sun. The desert knows two kinds of wells, the
<i>ain</i>, which properly speaking is a spring, and the <i>bir</i>
or <i>matan</i>, which is a place where water may be obtained by
digging in the sand. We call these wells of Ouenat <i>ains</i>, for
lack of a better word, although they are not springs but reservoirs
in the rock where rain-water collects.</p>

<p>There are said to be seven of these <i>ains</i> in the Ouenat
Mountains, of which I was to see four before I moved south again. I
also heard rumors of one or two <i>birs</i> in the oasis, but I did
not see them.</p>

<p>In the evening the camp was full of life and gaiety. The men
danced and sang as though there were no tedious days of hot sand
and scorching wind behind or ahead of them.</p>

<p><em>Monday, April 30.</em> Up early and went with Zerwali,
Abdullahi, Mohammed, and Malkenni, the Tebu, to the big <i>ain</i>
up the mountain. It was a stiff climb of an hour and a half. The
<i>ain</i> has a plentiful supply of splendid water and is
picturesquely surrounded with tall, slim reeds. I took some of the
reeds back with me to make pipe-stems. They give a pleasantly cool
smoke.</p>

<p>In the early evening I set out on the <i>hejin</i>, with
Malkenni, Senussi Bu Hassan, and Sad to explore the oasis. It was a
fine moonlight night with a warm southeast breeze. For four hours
we marched over <i>serira</i>, skirting the northwest corner of the
mountain, and at midnight we entered a valley with a chain of low
hills on our left and the sinister mountain with its fantastic rock
formations on our right. The valley is floored with soft sand
strewn with big stones, which made hard going for the camels. At
the hour when men’s spirits and courage are proverbially at the
lowest ebb we halted a few minutes for a draft of strong tea from
my thermos flask and then pushed on. But our spirits were by no
means low. There was something magical about the night and the
moonlight and the mountains, to make this an experience stirring to
the imagination and uplifting to the soul. I speak for myself; but
the men seemed to be getting something out of it too.</p>

<p>At five the valley opened out on to a wide plain of flat
<i>serira</i>, with hills ten or fifteen kilometers away to the
northeast. We turned sharply to the south, around a spur of the
mountain. At dawn we stopped for morning prayers.</p>

<p>The camels were <i>barrakked</i>, and we took our stand on the
sands facing toward Mecca. When Moslems take part in their
ceremonial prayers, they stand before God—not, as some misinformed
persons say, before Mohammed, who was not God but man, a prophet
and not the Deity—and the first essential is cleansing, of body,
heart, and soul. In the desert the cleansing of the body can be
only symbolical, since water cannot be spared. We take sand in our
hands, rub it over each hand and forearm, then gently over our
faces. With hands uplifted, palms upward, we say the prayers
appointed, then, kneeling, touch our foreheads to the cool sands of
the morning.</p>

<p>In the desert, prayers are no mere blind obedience to religious
dogma but an instinctive expression of one’s inmost self. The
prayers at night bring serenity and peace. At dawn, when new life
has suddenly taken possession of the body, one eagerly turns to the
Creator to offer humble homage for all the beauty of the world and
of life and to seek guidance for the coming day. One prays then,
not because one ought, but because one must.</p>

<p>Seven o’clock found us entering a wide valley, running a little
east of south, with mountains rising high on both sides. The floor
of the valley is as flat as a table, patterned with tufts of grass
and marked here and there with mimosa-trees and small shrubs, whose
leaves when crushed give off a fragrance similar to that of mint.
At intervals the ground is carpeted with creeping plants of the
colocynth, expanses of green leaves dotted with brilliant yellow
globes like grape-fruit. It is from this fruit that the Tebus and
Goran make <i>abra</i>. They boil the pips thoroughly to get rid of
their bitter taste and then crush them with dates or locusts in a
wooden mortar. <i>Abra</i> is their staple dish.</p>

<p>For three hours we proceeded up the valley, and at ten we camped
hot and tired but not ill content. We ate a good meal of rice,
drank our three glasses of tea, and went to sleep in the shade of a
ridge. It was uncomfortable slumber, what with swarming flies and
the moving shadow of the ridge, which made each of us shift
position from time to time.</p>

<p>As I opened my eyes a figure stood near me that seemed to be
part of a pleasant dream. She was a beautiful girl of the Goran,
the slim graceful lines of whose body were not spoiled by the
primitive garments she wore. She carried a bowl of milk, which she
offered with shy dignity. I could only accept it and drink
gratefully. Then she asked me for medicine for her sister, who had
borne no children. When she refused to believe that I had no
medicine that would be helpful to her sister, I fell back on my
malted milk tablets, a harmless remedy for ailments which were
beyond me. I also gave her a Medjidie and a silk handkerchief for
herself.</p>

<p>A Tebu appeared with a parcel of meat of the <i>waddan</i> or
wild sheep. I gave him macaroni and rice, and he went away
happy.</p>

<p>After we had eaten I went to see some relics of the presence of
men in earlier times. At Arkenu I had got to talking with one of
the Gorans, and, having satisfied myself about the present
inhabitants of Ouenat, I asked him whether he knew anything about
any former inhabitants of the oasis.</p>

<p>He gave me a startling answer: “Many different people have lived
round these wells, as far back as any one can remember. Even
<i>djinn</i> have dwelt in that place in olden days.”</p>

<p>“<i>Djinn!</i>” I exclaimed. “How do you know that?” “Have they
not left their drawings on the rocks?” he answered.</p>

<p>With suppressed excitement I asked him where. He replied that in
the valley of Ouenat there were many drawings upon the rocks, but I
could not induce him to describe them further than saying that
there were “writings and drawings of all the animals living, and
nobody knows what sort of pens they used, for they wrote very
deeply on the stones, and Time has not been able to efface the
writings.” Doing my best not to show anything like excitement, I
inquired whether he could tell me just where the drawings were.</p>

<p>“At the end of the valley, where the tail of the valley wags,”
he answered.</p>

<p>The whole time I remembered this, and after a little time spent
in making sure about the water, which is the most important thing,
and having a look round from the top of the hills at the
surrounding country, there came the exciting task of going round
the oasis. But the most exciting part of it was to find these rock
inscriptions, especially as the history that I had been able to
collect about the oasis was very scanty. I gathered that Ouenat was
the <i>pied-à-terre</i> of Tebus and Goran who were going eastward
to attack and despoil the Kababishe. Arkenu and Ouenat, indeed,
were very well placed for that purpose, since they provided water
for the attacking party and at the same time were too far away for
the Kababishe to dare attempt reprisals or try to recover their own
belongings.</p>

<p>With these drawings in mind, then, I took Malkenni, who had
joined the caravan at Arkenu, and toward sunset he led me straight
to them. They were in the valley at the part where it drew in,
curving slightly with a suggestion of the wagging tail. We found
them on the rock at the ground level. I was told there were other
similar inscriptions at half a day’s journey, but as it was growing
late and I did not want to excite suspicion, I did not go to
them.</p>

<p>There was nothing beyond the drawings of animals, no
inscriptions. It seemed to me as though they were drawn by somebody
who was trying to compose a scene. Although primitive in character,
they betrayed an artistic hand. The man who drew these outline
figures of animals had a decorative sense. On their wall of rock
these pictures were rudely, but not unskilfully carved. There were
lions, giraffes, and ostriches, all kinds of gazelles, and perhaps
cows, though many of these figures were effaced by time. The
carving is from a quarter to half an inch in depth, and the edges
of the lines are weathered until in some parts they can be scraped
off easily with the finger.</p>

<p>ZAGHAWA GIRL AND HER INFANT</p>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>I asked who made the pictures, and the only answer I got came
from Malkenni, the Tebu, who declared his belief that they were the
work of the <i>djinn</i>.</p>

<p>“What man,” he demanded, “can do these things now?”</p>

<p>I did not find any traditions about the origin of these
interesting rock-markings, but I was struck by two things. There
are no giraffes in this part of the country now; nor do they live
in any similar desert country anywhere. Also there are no camels
among the carvings on the rocks, and one cannot penetrate to this
oasis now except with camels. Did the men who made these pictures
know the giraffe and not the camel? I reflected that the camel came
to Africa from Asia some five hundred years <span class=
"sc2">B.C.</span></p>

<p>At 5:30 we started for the home camp. We wound our way up a
steep mountain path, hardly wide enough in places for a single man
and exceedingly dangerous going for the camels. We reached the
highest point of the path and then picked our way down to the
desert level south of the mountains. At the highest point we
reached there were a few peaks around, some two or three hundred
meters higher than we were. The camels went up and down the steep
path wonderfully well in spite of the darkness, and at 10:30 we
were at the foot of the mountains.</p>

<p>It seemed best to give the camels a rest, and we halted at
eleven for two hours. We had tea, and a Tebu family whose camp was
near came to visit us. We snatched a brief sleep and awoke
refreshed. There was a cool wind blowing, and the ride home over
the level desert was a pleasant relief after the hot work of
climbing about among the rocks.</p>

<p>We reached camp at 10 <span class="sc2">A. M.</span> of the
second and were met with firing of rifles and an agreeable
welcome.</p>

<p><em>Wednesday, May 2.</em> On reaching camp we found Sheikh
Herri, the Goran chief who is called King of Ouenat and its one
hundred and fifty inhabitants. He came the day before to visit me
and waited for my return. He was a very nice old man with a calm,
dignified face. He brought two sheep, milk, and <i>abra</i> for
<i>diafa</i>. He was keeping Ramadan, and I insisted on his staying
the night with us. Otherwise I could not offer him hospitality,
since he might not eat or drink until sunset.</p>

<p>I had a long talk with him and with Mohammed. The old chief was
still fond of his own country north of Wadai and sighed when it was
spoken of. He belonged to the Hezzi family, which is a ruling
family of Goran in northern Wadai. He came to Kufra as a voluntary
exile, when the French entered Wadai, and later he settled in
Ouenat.</p>

<p>I found myself tired after our twenty-eight hours of trekking
with only nine hours of rest, but a bath, a meal, and a short sleep
made life worth living again in the evening.</p>

<p>Bukara had organized a chorus among the men, and the evening was
spent with Bedouin, Tebu, and Sudanese songs.</p>

<p><em>Thursday, May 3.</em> Herri came to my tent with a bowl of
milk when I got up. When I thanked him, he shook his head
sadly.</p>

<p>“This is all I have to offer,” he said. “It is not worthy of
you. But you will forgive us for not being able to give you the
hospitality that you should have.”</p>

<p>I assured him that it is the spirit that counts in these matters
and not the the intrinsic value of the offering. The day was spent
in preparations for the start south, which I hoped would be made on
the morrow.</p>

<p><em>Friday, May 4.</em> I made an arrangement with Herri to go
with us to Erdi, as an additional guide. Mohammed had not been
through this country for a number of years, and I felt that Herri
should know it better.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I went for a long walk and took photographs of
the mountains. By this time all the Tebu and Goran settlements,
which are scattered about the oasis wherever there is grazing for
their beasts, had heard of our presence, and the people came to
visit us. There were many guests for dinner, and it was a very gay
camp. It was one of the pleasantest evenings of the trip.</p>

<p>Before we leave Ouenat I must say something about Bukara, who is
one of the most interesting people in the caravan and a romantic
figure. He is tall, slim, and wiry, a typical Bedouin, always
cheerful and with a song at his lips at those critical moments in
the day, early in the morning or late at night, when the men are
tired with the night march and need encouragement.</p>

<p>I did not know that he smoked until one day, as I was saddling
my horse, I caught him collecting the cigarette-ends from the spot
where my tent had stood. After this I shared my cigarettes with
him. It was great fun to hand him a packet of the precious articles
and see him break into a song and dance of joy.</p>

<div>
<p>MARKET AT UM BURU</p>
</div></div>

<p>Bukara is one of the most traveled Bedouins that I have come
across. He is only thirty-three, and yet he has traveled to Wadai,
Borku, Bornu, and Darfur. He has seen days of good fortune in the
past, but to-day he owns but one camel. He has thrown in his lot
with my caravan, arranging with Bu Helega that he is to have a
share of the money received for the latter’s camels when they are
sold at the end of the journey.</p>

<p>He speaks most of the dialects of the black tribes and knows a
great deal about them. He is also a wonderful mimic. One evening he
put on the green cloth that formed a partition in my tent as a
<i>burnoos</i> and, with Sad and Hamid bleating like sheep behind
him, came to the camp pretending to be a Bedouin <i>sheikh</i>,
bringing the two sheep as <i>diafa</i>. We were kept in roars of
laughter, and suddenly Bukara flung away the green cloth and,
snatching a spear from one of the Tebus, broke into a Tebu
war-dance. A Tebu assisted him by beating a rhythm on one of the
small empty <i>fantasses</i>. This droll exhibition was followed by
a concert of Bedouin songs from Cyrenaica, Fezzan, and Tripoli.</p>

<p>I have seen Bukara refuse to mount a camel to ride when all the
Bedouins have yielded to the temptation.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you ride, Bukara?” I asked. “There are several
unloaded camels.”</p>

<p>“What would my <i>washoon</i> [wife] say if she heard that her
Bukara had ridden between Arkenu and Ouenat?” he replied with scorn
in his voice for the thought.</p>

<p>He told me that on one occasion he had been intrusted with some
fifty camels to take to Ouenat for grazing. He was alone and ran
short of food.</p>

<p>“For twelve days I ate no meal, except the pips of colocynth,
which upset my digestion,” he replied simply. “Then I reached
Kufra. The men at Kufra who had sent me for the camels had
forgotten to send me food. They had expected me at Kufra
earlier.”</p>

<p>“But why didn’t you slaughter a camel?” I inquired.</p>

<p>“Should I permit the men of Kufra to say that Bukara could not
endure hunger and had killed a camel?” he retorted proudly.</p>

<p>Bukara is very fond of his wife. When we reached Arkenu he said
to me: “I am feeling better now, but I cried like a child when I
said good-by to my <i>washoon</i> at Kufra. It is always like that
when I begin my journeys. If the company is good I forget more
quickly.”</p>

<h2><a id="chap18"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<p class="sub_chapter">NIGHT MARCHES TO ERDI</p>

<p><em>Sunday, May 6.</em> We got away at 6:45 <span class="sc2">P.
M.</span> and made a good twelve hours’ trek of fifty-four
kilometers. It was a thoroughly tiring performance, however, as the
first night’s march was likely to be. The men had had no chance to
sleep during the day, but on the contrary had been busier than
usual. In spite of our weariness the loads had to be carefully
watched and readjusted every now and then. At dawn most of the men
dropped back for short naps.</p>

<p>One of the camels broke away and ran back toward Ouenat;
Malkenni had to leave the caravan at midnight and go after it.</p>

<p>There was moonlight the latter half of the night and a
refreshing cool breeze at three in the morning. The camels grazed,
as they went, on the grass which grew here because of the water
coming down from the hills.</p>

<p>When we came to make camp one of our best <i>girbas</i> was
found torn and half empty. It was a misfortune, for we could not
spare water on the trek that was before us. We had to go ten days
before reaching a well. Malkenni and the runaway camel did not
appear during the day.</p>

<p>My diary runs:</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p><em>Monday, May 7.</em> Cloudy all day. Strong northeast wind,
which drops in afternoon. Highest temperature 38°. When traveling
at night cannot take minimum temperature, which occurs about 2 or
3, as we are on the move at that time. Start at 6:30 <span class=
"sc2">P. M.</span>, halt at 11:30 <span class="sc2">P. M.</span>
Make 20 kilometers. Very soft sand, undulating, with dry
<i>sabat</i> for grazing.</p>
</div>

<p>In the afternoon a Tebu arrived with a camel loaded with the
luggage that had been on the runaway. He told us that Malkenni’s
camel had thrown off its load and run back to the grazing ground at
Ouenat, with Malkenni after him. At 11:30 we halted on very soft
sand with patches of rock about and grazing ground near Baret
Shezzu, to wait for the runaways. They appeared shortly after our
arrival; but I decided not to go farther that night. The rest would
do us all good.</p>

<p><em>Tuesday, May 8.</em> We started at 4:45 <span class="sc2">P.
M.</span> in an oppressive atmosphere under heavy clouds. Two hours
later it rained a little, and the Bedouins, whose life depends on
rain, instinctively shouted with joy and sang fervently to the
camels.</p>

<div class="figcenter iw1">
<a id="illus74"></a>

<div>
<p>EXPLORER'S CAMP AT UM BURU</p>
</div></div>

<p>The ground was undulating, hard, and covered with stones and
large gravel. We crossed some small <i>gherds</i> soon after
starting, and then the country flattened out again, with softer
sand. At 3:30 <span class="sc2">A. M.</span> we entered a belt of
high sand-dunes and crossed it in an hour and a half. After the
dunes the ground became the old familiar <i>serira</i> again. Here
I found bits of ostrich-shells.</p>

<p>Early in the day Arami, Malkenni’s brother, had taken a sack and
gone to collect <i>hatab</i>. His name tells his story, for among
the Tebus and Goran a man who has killed another is known frankly
as Arami. He had said that he would meet us later on. We had no
anxiety about him, especially as we were told that he knew the way
well.</p>

<p>But when we had been two hours on the road and it was growing
dark we became anxious and halted to wait for him. We fired many
shots to attract his attention and direct him to where we were. The
men shouted his name as loud as they could, but all in vain. I
turned to Malkenni and asked him what he intended to do.</p>

<p>“My brother is mad,” he said. “No one asked him to collect
<i>hatab</i>. He left the camp without even having his breakfast.
It may be that he has been called by God to his death. When the
moon rises I shall leave my camel’s load and return to look for
him. If he is alive I shall bring him back with me; if he is dead I
shall bury him and join you later.”</p>

<p>It was said quite simply and as though it were all a matter of
course. The load was shifted from Malkenni’s camel to another, and
he set out on the back track. Arami had already had many narrow
escapes from death, and every one hoped that it might be so this
time. But Mohammed was doubtful.</p>

<p>“God is merciful,” he said, “but I think Arami has walked to his
fate.”</p>

<p>I was afraid he might be right. There was something strange
about Arami from the first. I learned that on a trek once from Erdi
to Ouenat his water-supply had run out and he had had a “bad
thirst,” as the desert people call it. He had reached Ouenat half
dead. Such an experience leaves its mark on a man, and it is likely
to be long before he is himself again. I had noticed the queer,
strained, vague look in his eyes and wondered about it. If he did
not come back, the desert, in one of its moods of cruelty, would
have claimed its own.</p>

<p>In the desert upon the long, waterless treks, the men, from
exhaustion, thirst, fatigue, sleeplessness, often lose their heads,
and, as the Bedouins say, “walk to their fate”; which means that
unless their comrades are on the lookout and keep them with the
caravan they walk away into the desert disregarding even the animal
instinct of the camel to keep with the herd. In such a case, if the
wanderer suddenly returns to his senses, he has to sit down where
he finds himself and not move. It is understood that his comrades
when they are aware of his absence will retrace the tracks of the
caravan and then his own tracks upon the sand and so rescue him. I
met a Bedouin at Kufra who had been lost for eighteen hours, cut
off from the caravan. When he was rescued he was unconscious,
suffering badly from thirst. “God was merciful,” he told me, “for I
was just able to do my prayers and face God before what I thought
was my inevitable death. But we live and die only by the decree of
God,” he added with a smile.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p><em>Wednesday, May 9.</em> Start 4:15 <span class="sc2">P.
M.</span>, halt at 10:15 <span class="sc2">P. M.</span> Make 24
kilometers. Highest temperature 37°. White clouds and very strong
warm wind from the northeast, which continues all day and at night
develops into a sand-storm. A few drops of rain fall at 7
<span class="sc2">P. M.</span> The sand-storm lasts from 8 to 10.
The ground is ordinary <i>serira</i>, with soft sand in places.
There are no landmarks and no dry grass. We sight distant
sand-dunes on our right in the early morning.</p>
</div>

<p>We marched fourteen and a half hours last night, but we were not
very tired. Breakfast and four hours’ sleep found us all refreshed
again. Mohammed wanted us to make an early start, as there was a
difficult <i>gherd</i> ahead which could not be crossed in the
dark. So 4:15 found us under way, with <i>serira</i> under our feet
and a cool northeast wind behind us. Shortly after eight I felt the
wind in my face. I was startled, for the wind does not usually
shift so suddenly. Besides, the quality of the wind had not
changed. This wind in our faces should be coming from the south,
and yet it is not warm. There is something strange about it. I look
above for the stars, but the sky is completely covered with dark
clouds. I take out my compass and am startled to find that we were
heading full northeast instead of southwest. Then it is clear to me
that Mohammed has “lost his head,” as the Bedouins say, and is
leading us in the diametrically opposite direction from the right
one.</p>

<p>It was a serious moment and one that required tact and careful
handling. It is dangerous to undermine a desert guide’s confidence.
I got off my camel and, mounting my horse, galloped to where
Mohammed is leading the caravan.</p>

<p>I realized as I went that the men of the caravan, most of whom
were accustomed to this sort of country and this kind of weather,
had also a feeling that we were going wrong. But it is the
etiquette of the desert that no one may interfere with the guide in
any way. The guide of a caravan is exactly like the captain of a
ship. He is absolute master of the caravan so far as direction is
concerned, and must also be consulted as to the starting and
halting times.</p>

<div class="figcenter iw1">

<br>
<img src="images/illus75.jpg" alt="">
<div>
<p>ZAGHAWA CHIEFS COMING OUT TO WELCOME THE PARTY AT UM BURU</p>
</div></div>

<p>I had fortunately asked Mohammed before leaving Ouenat as to the
direction we were to take and had set my compass to it. As I
approach the guide I find him agitated and lacking his habitual
cheerful smile and air of self-reliance. I show him the compass and
suggest that we are going in the wrong direction. He says nothing
but scans the sky anxiously for his favorite Jadi, but in vain, for
Polaris is behind the clouds.</p>

<p>At this moment the sand-storm, which had been rising, blew out
his lantern. The caravan had caught up with us, and every one
realized that we had lost our way. Men and camels were huddled
together, with the gale and hurtling sand beating upon them. The
wind made it impossible to hear one’s own voice, to say nothing of
any other man’s.</p>

<p>Mohammed’s confidence had completely deserted him, and I could
see its effect on the men’s faces. They were all traveled men of
the desert, and they know what it meant to lose one’s way in a
<i>serira</i>, where there are no landmarks.</p>

<p>“We must camp until the sky clears,” is the chorus.</p>

<p>But I know how fatal such a policy would be. They would spend
four or five hours brooding over their fate and growing more and
more despondent and hopeless. There is no need for a halt, as my
compass is a reliable one, and I have checked it many times with
the directions pointed out by Mohammed.</p>

<p>“This wind comes from the north,” I asserted quietly but with
assurance during a lull in the storm, “as it has for the past few
days. If it came from the south it would be hot. There is the Jadi,
and this is our route.”</p>

<p>I pointed to where Polaris must be, unless the compass was all
wrong, and then swung around and indicated the way that we should
go.</p>

<p>“Allah bless you,” replied Mohammed, pulling himself together.
“What you say is true.”</p>

<p>Senussi Bu Hassan, who was our guide to Kufra, came close to me
and in a loud voice confirmed the statement.</p>

<p>“Wallahi, you speak truth,” he said firmly. “I had thought of it
but could not speak as I had no proof, since the Jadi hides himself
behind the clouds.”</p>

<p>That was enough for us. We lighted the lantern with difficulty,
and with Mohammed and Bu Hassan beside me I led the way.</p>

<p>“How are we going to march?” demands a voice from the
darkness.</p>

<p>“Let the wind fan the back of your black neck, and you won’t go
much wrong,” answers Bukara with a laugh.</p>

<p>A few hours later Mohammed grips my hand and, pointing to the
sand-dunes ahead, ejaculates with deep feeling: “The <i>gherds!</i>
Praise be to God! God is generous!” He is perfectly cheerful
again.</p>

<p>The storm soon subsided completely, and we were among the
sand-dunes. The sky was perfectly clear now, and even the most
pessimistic of the men could have no more anxiety. But our little
experience in this sand-storm demonstrated what a touch-and-go
business desert trekking could be at times. It was only my compass
that saved us from a very serious situation.</p>

<p>Mohammed was doubtful of the wisdom of trying to cross the
<i>gherds</i> in the darkness, and so we made our camp where we
were.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p><em>Thursday, May 10.</em> Start at 4:15 <span class="sc2">A.

at 4:30 <span class="sc2">P. M.</span>, halt at 7 <span class=

clear. Strong cold wind in the early morning, moderating later.
Highest temperature 38°. Sand-dunes, 2 kilometers in width, of very
soft sand, dangerous in places. Then ordinary <i>serira</i>. At

</div>

<p>In the early morning we got under way to cross the <i>gherds</i>
and speedily realized how serious a mistake it would have been to
tackle them in the darkness. They were very steep, and the sand was
treacherously soft. The camels sank to their knees and had to be
helped by the men. It took us three quarters of an hour to cross
them. We halted at 9 <span class="sc2">A. M.</span> very hungry,
for we had not eaten since lunch the day before. We needed food
more than sleep, since the few hours of rest during the night were
quite refreshing.</p>

<p>It was still hot when we started again at 4:30 <span class=
"sc2">P. M.</span>, but a pleasant northeast breeze tempered the
oppressiveness. Herri asked me for a few yards of white cloth to
make a turban, because the heat of the sun was affecting his head.
I was glad to give it to him. Among the Tebus and Goran only
<i>sheikhs</i> wear white.</p>

<p>I felt like walking that night and rode my camel less than
usual. Since leaving Ouenat I had been walking six or seven hours a
night, but that night I did nine. We made good progress until 3
<span class="sc2">A. M.</span>, when I suddenly felt or heard
something rustle against my ankle-boot. I reached down and found
grass. The desert had changed its aspect. The camels were hungry,
for we set out from Ouenat with only two days’ food for them,
trusting to the opportunities for grazing that we expected to find.
So we let them eat as they went along instead of driving them at
their best pace.</p>

<p>That night’s march was tiring for everybody. We had arrears of
sleep to make up, and keeping the camels going in grazing country
was hard work. Mohammed and Herri both rode most of the way, with
Hassan carrying the lantern. Just before dawn, however, Mohammed
got down and relieved him. When we rounded up the camels for our
morning prayers the men looked more weary than I had ever seen
them.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p><em>Friday, May 11.</em> Start at 4:45 <span class="sc2">P.
M.</span>, halt at 3:15 <span class="sc2">A. M.</span> (of the
12th). Make 42 kilometers. Clear and fine. No wind. Warm all day
and night. Highest temperature 39°. Soft sand covered with dry
tufts of grass like a field of ripe corn. At 12:45 <span class=
"sc2">A. M.</span> pass an ordinary <i>gherd</i>. At 1 enter flat
<i>serira</i> without grass. At 3:15 halt at sandstone hills,
having missed our way.</p>
</div>

<p>The day was spent in sleeping and eating, and at 4:45
<span class="sc2">P. M.</span> we started with the intention of
marching all night. But by ten everybody was tired and sleepy. Even
Mohammed was riding his camel. In the next few hours he fell asleep
at intervals and because of his fatigue did not look back to
correct his direction by Polaris. When a guide neglects the Jadi he
is far gone indeed. Senussi Bu Hassan and I felt certain that he
was not taking the right course but did not want to interfere with
him again after the previous night.</p>

<p>At 3:15 <span class="sc2">A. M.</span> we came to a ridge of
hills, and Mohammed stopped dead. Until now I had been walking
behind the caravan and checking from time to time the bearing on
which we were going. We had been walking since ten o’clock more to
the southward than before. When the caravan halted I rode forward
to Mohammed and asked why we were stopping.</p>

<p>“This opening in the hills,” he says, pointing in front of him.
“I do not recognize it, and I do not know what kind of ground
follows it.” Whatever his faults he is perfectly frank.</p>

<p>I did not want to arouse any feeling of anxiety in the men, and
so I said casually: “Let us camp until daybreak. We are all tired
to-night.” I have hardly spoken the words when the camels are
<i>barrakked</i> and their loads are on the ground. I have never
seen men fall so quickly to sleep. Each one wraps himself swiftly
in his <i>jerd</i> and takes shelter from the cold northeast wind
behind a piece of luggage.</p>

<p>Mohammed goes up the ridge to look about him, and I follow.</p>

<p>“I think you have been following the Jadi too much,” I suggest,
meaning that he had been going too directly south. I do not
intimate that he has been asleep on his camel. I do not want to
shake his self-confidence and have him become demoralized.</p>

<p>“Allah bless you,” he murmurs, scanning the horizon anxiously.
“I must have done so, for we should not have reached hills so
early. I counted on getting to them at dawn. But in the morning God
will bring solace.”</p>

<p>I am somewhat troubled as I leave him, and lie awake a few
minutes hoping that we have not gone far from our proper path. But
I am too tired to worry long and go quickly to sleep.</p>

<p><em>Saturday, May 12.</em> At 4:30 <span class="sc2">A.
M.</span> Mohammed’s voice is heard. “To prayers, O ye Moslems!” We
quickly get up and are under way in an hour. Mohammed puts himself
at the head of the caravan, and I join him. He is still troubled,
but as we round a corner of the hills he sighs with relief.</p>

<p>“Allah be praised. There lies our way.”</p>

<p>He points to the northwest corner of the chain of hills, and we
make for it. We reach it at 9:45 <span class="sc2">A. M.</span> and
pitch camp. The camels are sent a kilometer or two into the hills
to graze. Men and camels are in bad shape, and water is getting
scarce.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Mohammed and Herri go ahead into the hills to
make a track in the sand with a tent-pole for us to follow. At 5
<span class="sc2">P. M.</span> we follow them into the sand-dunes
and thence into the hills. The <i>gherds</i> are fortunately not
many, though they are steep enough. But it is the hilly country
beyond them that takes it out of us. Our feet keep bumping into
stones in the dark, and Bedouin shoes are little protection against
such painful encounters. The collisions are particularly numerous
and correspondingly trying in the early morning hours when we are
terribly sleepy and walk with eyes half shut.</p>

<p>On previous nights I have tried the experiment of suddenly
firing two or three shots from my rifle to rouse the men to life,
and with good results. Each time they have responded with a loud
cheer and mended their pace forthwith. But to-night the scheme
fails. About three in the morning, the most deadly hour of all, I
“empty gunpowder,” but not a voice responds.</p>

<p>There is one small compensation, however, in the midst of this
dead expanse of fatigue and depression. The crescent moon rises in
the early morning, a curved silver thread with a brilliant star
above it, an exquisite piece of celestial jewelry. I fix my eyes on
their beauty and forget for a moment the bruises that my poor feet
are getting.</p>

<p>When, a little later, we reach a patch of dry grass, we are all
ready to let the camels graze for a while and to give our tired
bodies a brief respite. At dawn we halt again for morning prayers.
We have barely risen from our knees when most of the men wrap
themselves in their <i>jerds</i> and fall on the beautiful red sand
like white stones. The caravan goes limping on, and the sleepers
join us presently, I hope a little refreshed.</p>

<p>My limbs ache this morning and cannot be made comfortable. I try
every possible position on my camel and every possible pace and
stride in walking, but none of them are of any avail. My eyelids
too seem weighted with lead.</p>

<p>At six we have the good fortune to come across a few patches of
green grass and make camp, having marched for thirteen tormented
hours. Eyes are bloodshot, and bodies are protesting in every
muscle and sinew. In a half-hour it is a dead camp.</p>

<p><em>Sunday, May 13.</em> We were up at 10 <span class="sc2">A.
M.</span> for breakfast. The men went to sleep again, but I could
not. We started again at 5:15 <span class="sc2">P. M.</span>, and
this evening things were worse than ever. The country had become
more undulating and broken, and both camels and men found the going
disastrously painful. Camels were continually being left behind as
we wound about among the dunes and little hills of rock. They found
bits of grass and fell to grazing. It was very difficult to see
them against the red sand spotted with patches of dark stone.</p>

<p>The singing stopped early that night, the surest sign that the
men were dead tired. Zerwali told me that Mohammed had come to him
to say that we had better camp early and not try to march too long
to-night. The going was so difficult and we changed directions so
often to go around the elevated points and stone outcroppings that
there was danger of our losing our way. But Zerwali, knowing how
averse I am to any delay, had told the guide that I wanted to make
a night’s march of it.</p>

<p>At last the walking was so hard and camels were so continually
left behind that I felt there was no use in going farther. If I had
needed any more proof that the men were spent it would have been
supplied by the fact that Hassan, the Wajangi, ordinarily a sturdy
walker, had taken to a camel early in the evening and had not come
off it.</p>

<p>We camped at 11:30 <span class="sc2">P. M.</span> I wrapped
myself in my <i>jerd</i> and told the men not to bother about
making a shelter for me. I am sure I did not move from the first
position I dropped into until five. I got up with a stiff back and
aching legs.</p>

<p>The morning air was serene and refreshing, and the sight of the
men busy and eager to go ahead made me forget my physical
discomforts. In spite of the new spirit of cheerfulness which the
morning brought, however, things were not too encouraging for us.
The country was nearly as bad for trekking as it could be. The men
seemed to be losing confidence in Mohammed and Herri. The camels
were in bad condition, and our water was very low.</p>

<div class="excerpt">
<p><em>Monday, May 14.</em> Start at 6 <span class="sc2">A.
M.</span>, halt at 9 <span class="sc2">A. M.</span>, start again at
5:30 <span class="sc2">P. M.</span>, halt at 10 <span class=
"sc2">P. M.</span> Make 30 kilometers. Fair and clear. Cool
northeast breeze at 7 <span class="sc2">A. M.</span>, which drops
at midday. Calm evening and night. Highest temperature 32°. Soft
sand covered with grass, both green and dry. Shortly after start in
afternoon country changes into undulating ground with valleys full
of green grass and dry <i>nisha</i>. This is one of the signs that
we are approaching Erdi. At 6:30 <span class="sc2">P. M.</span>
hilly again for about 4 kilometers, and then we pass a big valley
with grazing and trees.</p>
</div>

<p>As we started again in the morning I intended to go forward for
four or five hours, but it speedily got too hot, and we camped at
nine. The four hours’ rest had its good effect, and no one went to
sleep until we had had breakfast.</p>

<p>In the afternoon Mohammed and Herri went ahead again to mark the
way, as there was even more difficult going before us.</p>

<p>The caravan got under way at 5:30 <span class="sc2">P. M.</span>
Our water had become scarce and bad, and the camels looked weak and
exhausted. We were anxious to reach Erdi as soon as possible.
Shortly after the start Bukara and Arami—not the one who went away
into the desert and disappeared, but another who had also killed
his man—found the track of a big <i>warran</i> or lizard, and we
followed it to its hole. A little sport was a pleasant relief. We
dug into the hole, but the lizard was not at home. We traced its
track to a pile of rocks and after twenty minutes of excavation
caught the creature.</p>

<p>The Bedouins and blacks use the fat of the <i>warran</i> as
medicine for rheumatism and say that if one carries its head about
with him he is safe against black magic. Its skin hung in a house
is reputed to keep snakes at a distance. The <i>warran</i> does not
bite, but it has a tail like a whip with which it can do damage.
Arami skinned the creature for me.</p>

<p>We followed the track made by our guides but lost it many times
in the dark and wasted time finding it again. At last it began to
wabble about, and I realized that Mohammed was by no means certain
of his direction. I ordered the men to camp and fired shots into
the air. Shortly we were joined by Mohammed and Herri, who were
relieved that I had decided to halt. The guide told me that he
could not be sure of his road in this country in the darkness, but
that he knew we were not far from the well.</p>

<p>For the first time since leaving Ouenat we had five solid hours
of undisturbed sleep. Before going to bed I talked to Arami about
Erdi and its wells.</p>

<p>“Mohammed is a good guide by daylight,” he said, “but he is old,
and at night he does not see much. Besides, he has not been to this
country for several years. We should have camped at the first well
this evening, but we have missed it. But God knows best.” I told
him to say nothing of this to the men, lest they should grow more
panicky and blame Mohammed.</p>

<p>I prepared my sleeping-bag and sat down to think. This was the
most discouraging moment of the journey. The men had lost
confidence and had suffered much from the heat; the camels were
dead beat, largely from the same cause; the guide was not sure of
the way; and the water was scarce and bad. Any one of these
circumstances would have been enough to make one anxious, but all
together made a devastating assault upon one’s nerve.</p>

<p>As I reviewed the difficulties and dangers of the trip thus far,
there flashed through my mind the thought that neither the mad
Arami nor his brother Malkenni, who went to find him, had been seen
again. I found myself wondering whether Fate intended to rob me of
what I had been able to achieve. If Fate is malicious, this was an
opportune moment to strike. If I had missed Arkenu and Ouenat, it
would not have been so hard. But now that I had made my modest
achievement, I felt I should like to get back home with it. But—God
knows best. I wondered if it would be a sleepless night. But the
magic of the desert again came into play, and I was surprised to
find my eyelids growing heavier. The sleep that came was sweet.</p>

<p><em>Tuesday, May 15.</em> We were up at four. Still uncertain
where we were, Herri, Mohammed, and I went forward to make a
reconnaissance, when suddenly the red hills of Erdi leaped into
view. I satisfied myself by a good look through my binocular that
we were not mistaken, and an hour later we started toward them.
Before we started there was a discussion as to whether we should
camp on the hills above the valley in which the well lies or go
down into it. The descent would be hard on the camels, but
nevertheless we decided to make it and camp on the floor of the
<i>wadi</i>. In case of an attack by marauders we should at least
have possession of the water-supply.</p>

<p>We had been steadily climbing through rough defiles between
cliffs of red rock, and suddenly we came out on the top of a high
cliff with the pleasant <i>wadi</i> of Erdi lying stretched out
below us. It is a narrow valley, about ten kilometers long by not
more than one hundred meters wide, surrounded by sheer cliffs of
red rock. Trees and green grass, after the monotonous <i>serira</i>
and the bare, unfriendly rocks that we have been traversing since
Ouenat, suggest all the traditional connotations of the phrase “an
oasis in the desert.” As we approached the well, Mohammed and Herri
went forward again to reconnoiter the ground. The blacks are always
cautious when they come to a well. They do not approach it directly
but send a man or two ahead to make sure that if any one is already
there he is not a stranger or at least not an enemy. So the two
guides will not only mark out the path we are to follow but will
discover if we need be on our guard when approaching a well.</p>

<p>We picked our way laboriously down the rough path into the
valley and pitched camp at its northern end. The well lies at the
extreme south, and there is no way of getting to it safely from
above—without great risk to the camels—except where we came
down.</p>

<p>A huge meal of rice and freshly baked bread, combined with our
pleasant surroundings, made us all as cheerful as a wedding party.
My anxious thoughts of the previous night seemed now like an absurd
nightmare, and yet there was plenty of truth in them. There is
often in the desert only a hair’s-breadth between safety and
comfort and disaster.</p>

<p>After three glasses of stimulating tea, over which we all
lingered luxuriously, the men went off to the well to water the
camels and to bring back water for the camp. When they returned, a
shave, a bath, and clean clothes restored all my self-respect and
confidence, and life seemed very good again.</p>

<p>At five in the afternoon I climbed the wall of the valley with
the theodolite and took observations. Zerwali went with Senussi Bu
Hassan and Arami on a hunt for <i>waddan</i>, the mountain sheep,
but they came back unsuccessful. I asked Arami if it were the fault
of the sportsmen. “Wallahi [by God], no, they shoot straight, but
God was merciful to the <i>waddan</i>.”</p>

<p>Night fell on a camp of rested camels and cheerful, singing men.
I felt I should have none but pleasant dreams to-night.</p>

<p>WELL ON THE FRONTIER OF DARFUR</p>
</div></div>

<h2><a id="chap19"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>

<p class="sub_chapter">ENTERING THE SUDAN</p>

<p>I got up early in order to open the film-box and refill the
cameras while it was still cool. At seven, with Mohammed and Hamad,
I set out to visit the well. The valley of Erdi is what is known as
a <i>karkur</i>, a long narrow depression in the hills which winds
like a snake. It runs to the southward for seven or eight
kilometers ending in a <i>cul-de-sac</i> where the well lies in a
shadowy hollow under the rocks. The pool is semicircular in shape,
half a dozen meters long and half as broad. The well is like those
at Ouenat, although I suspect that in addition to the rain-water it
may possibly be fed by a spring. The approach to it is a rocky and
somewhat dangerous climb. The night before one of the camels
bringing water slipped and hurt itself rather badly.</p>

<p>We climbed up to the <i>ain</i>, had a rest and tea, and rode
home under a hot sun. The valley is beautiful, with its sheer walls
of red rock, and the green grass and trees scattered about below
them. Mohammed told me that it is the most difficult valley in this
region to enter and therefore the easiest to defend.</p>

<p>In the late afternoon I climbed the valley wall to watch the
fine sunset and the play of the light on the red sand and the
rose-colored rocks. The men shaved their heads, trimmed their
beards, and washed and mended their clothes, which were becoming
very tattered.</p>

<p>The grazing here just saved our camels, and it was wise to take
this day for rest and recuperation. Mohammed and Herri told me that
from now on it would not be practicable to travel at night. The
country was too hilly to be safe to traverse in the darkness. All
the Bedouins gave Mohammed credit for the way he led the camels
over the steep rocks to the valley yesterday.</p>

<p>In the evening the dog had a fit of barking, and we suspected
that some one was near. We quickly put out the fires, gathered the
camels together, made ready the rifles, and put sentries out around
the camp; but it was a false alarm.</p>

<p>These precautions, like those we take when approaching a well,
seem absurd when it is all over and nothing has happened. But in
unknown country like this the caravan that did not take them would
be very foolish. An attack by hostile tribesmen or outlaws is far
from an improbability.</p>

<p><em>Thursday, May 17.</em> We were up at four and under way at
5:30. The climb out of the valley was as difficult as the descent,
and one camel fell, but fortunately without serious results. As we
reached the edge of the <i>wadi</i> and looked back I realized the
difference between the valleys in these hills and those at Arkenu
and Ouenat. There the floor of a valley is on the same level as the
plain outside, and one goes into it by a pass as through a gateway.
In the region we were now in, the valleys are depressed below the
general level of the country, and one drops down into them by
winding, rocky paths.</p>

<p>In an hour we were out of the <i>wadi</i> and turned to the
southeast. We were in a mountainous country of black and red rocks,
and it was clear that we could not travel over such <i>terrain</i>
in the dark. At 9:30 we descended into a large valley by a steep
path, on which two camels stumbled and threw off their loads. One,
carrying water, very nearly broke its neck; but the presence of
mind of Abdullahi, who drew a knife and cut the girths, saved the
situation. The wooden stopper of one of the <i>fantasses</i> came
out, and the water was three-quarters spilled. Fortunately the next
well was only three days ahead, and we had an ample supply for even
a longer trek. Such an occurrence as this would have been a
disaster if we had been in a <i>daffa</i>, as a long waterless trek
between wells is called.</p>

<p>On this morning a serious situation arose suddenly which might
have had fatal results had it not been for two pieces of luck.
Ahmed, the cook who came with me from Egypt, was riding a camel
without a bridle. He had asked Hamid, the camelman of Bu Helega, to
provide a bridle; but the other, being wise in the ways of camels,
knew better than to do so. It is important that the camels be able
to graze at will. They are more in need of food than of
guidance.</p>

<p>Ahmed’s camel, spying a fine tuft of grass, went directly to it.
On the way he passed under a tree set thickly with thorns. The
rider could not escape the sharp projections, and his face was
badly torn. Annoyed by the pain, Ahmed proceeded to curse the camel
and the owner of the camels. Hamid instantly retaliated by cursing
him and telling him not to curse the noble owner of the animals. I
happened to be near, and in my heart I praised the camelman for his
loyalty to Bu Helega, his master.</p>

<p>Ahmed came quickly off the camel, his face streaked with blood,
and went hotly at Hamid. Senussi Bu Hassan, the other Hamid, and
Sad, the Aujili, rushed to take the side of their brother Bedouin.
Abdullahi ranged himself beside Ahmed, two Egyptians shoulder to
shoulder.</p>

</div>

<p>I had had experience of such quarrels before, and I quickly
looked to see where the rifles were. It was with deep relief that I
saw them safely fastened on the camels’ backs. The men had only
sticks to fight with, but, even so, prompt action was necessary
before the trouble became more acute.</p>

<p>I galloped my horse among the men and pushed him between the two
groups of combatants, brusquely ordering Ahmed and Abdullahi to
stand back. It was a most difficult moment, with one side my own
men and the other the men of my caravan.</p>

<p>Senussi Bu Hassan and Hamid looked back, and for the flicker of
a second I saw their eyes rest on the slung rifles. One word of
encouragement from me to the other party would have meant disaster,
for the Bedouins outnumbered us. On the other hand, it was not the
time, even if my own men were in the wrong, to humiliate them
before the Bedouins.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by behaving like children?” I demanded
impartially of the men on both sides. “Men like you ought to be
ashamed.”</p>

<p>Hamid started to speak. “He insulted me.”</p>

<p>Ahmed interrupted him. “He attacked me as I came off my
camel.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care who insulted whom or who attacked whom,” I
declared sharply. “You are all my men, and it is a shame to have
you behave like a batch of children.”</p>

<p>Just then Zerwali came up. I turned to Abdullahi and then to
Senussi Bu Hassan. “And you older men, instead of bringing peace,
actually take part in this disgraceful quarrel,” I said severely.
“Perhaps I have made a mistake. I should have chosen men for my
caravan and not boys.”</p>

<p>By this time both parties had begun to cool down and to lose
their tense look of men about to spring to the attack. Zerwali, who
probably expected me to take the side of my compatriots, Abdullahi
and Ahmed, was disarmed and did the unexpected thing.</p>

<p>“Put Hamid on the ground,” he ordered the slave Faraj. “I will
beat him with my whip.”</p>

<p>In a flash the stalwart Faraj laid Hamid unceremoniously on the
ground and pinned him there with his knee. Before I could interfere
Zerwali’s whip descended twice. But by that time I had dismounted
and caught Zerwali’s arm.</p>

<p>“This is no matter for punishment,” I asserted. “We don’t know
who is to blame. I shall inquire into the matter and punish with my
own hands the man who is proved guilty.”</p>

<p>Turning to the men I commanded, “Follow the camels.”</p>

<p>To Mohammed and Herri, who had kept tactfully out of the affair,
I gave the order, “Lead the way,” pointing with my stick.</p>

<p>All moved off, and I walked alone, trying to preserve for their
benefit my expression of stern disapproval. Zerwali gradually edged
nearer to me and spoke deprecatingly.</p>

<p>“The bey is not angry over what has happened?” he questioned.
“God knows when I got up this morning there was something weighing
heavy on my heart. I felt sure that something unpleasant was going
to happen. My feeling was reflected in your salutation to me.”</p>

<p>I realized that I also had had an uncanny feeling. There was no
reason for it, for everything was going smoothly and well. But
still something had oppressed me.</p>

<p>In a short while both parties felt like children who had been
naughty. I observed furtive glances stealing toward me from both
sides to see if my anger was abated. But I kept my stern
countenance until luncheon.</p>

<p>Those who have traveled in the desert and know the Bedouins will
realize what a serious possibility this incident contained. A
single harsh word interpreted as an insult means shooting if guns
are close at hand. If both men had had their rifles and if I had
been some hundred yards away, as was generally the case, there
would almost certainly have been bloodshed. The Bedouins would
probably have killed Ahmed and Abdullahi out of hand. Then what
could I have done, as an Egyptian, but avenge the killing of my
countrymen at whatever cost to myself?</p>

<p>How lucky it was that the rifles were lashed to the camels and
that I was close at hand!</p>

<p>“We are getting near the end of our journey,” said Zerwali. “The
men are always quarrelsome then.”</p>

<p>By the time this dangerous incident was over, the sun was very
hot, and we camped in the valley in the shade of some fine trees.
The camels had good grazing while we ate and rested. Before we
started in the afternoon Mohammed, Senussi Bu Hassan, Bukara, and
Hamid, the camelman, came to ask me to forgive Hamid for having let
his anger get the better of him with Ahmed. I pardoned him readily,
and he went to Ahmed and kissed his head. Ahmed returned the
compliment, and then the quarrel was ended in the best Bedouin
tradition.</p>

<p>We made our way down the big valley for three hours and camped
near its mouth at 7:15. Shortly before halting we saw ahead of us
the distant hills of Agah, where the next well lay. The ground
before us was flat <i>serira</i>, and it was a relief to see it. On
this morning when we were going down into the valley it looked as
if all our baggage would be in bits if there were more of these
precipices. In places the descent was so rough that for safety we
had to unload the camels. The men had to carry the baggage down the
steep rocks, often a drop of three feet from boulder to
boulder.</p>

<p>The new moon had risen as we camped. The next day was Bairam,
the feast marking the end of Ramadan, and Zerwali came to say that
the men would like to feast according to our Moslem custom. I
willingly agreed, since the Agah Hills were in sight before us and
the water-supply was ample. Besides, the excellent grazing in this
valley would do the camels good.</p>

<p>We all rose early the next day (Friday, May 18) and put on clean
clothes for the feast-day. We exchanged good wishes and followed
them with the prayers appointed for Bairam. There was a look on
every face as of men who are thinking of those left behind at
home.</p>

<p>I produced a few Medjidies and Egyptian notes and distributed
them. The coins went to Mohammed, Herri, Hassan, and Arami, who
were to leave us before we reached territory where Egyptian notes
are current. The rest got the notes, which they would be able to
use at El Fasher. To Zerwali I gave twenty rounds of revolver
ammunition and a bottle of scent. Another bottle of scent was
divided among the men; Bukara received one of my pipes and tobacco
to go with it, and he declared that he did not know what to do to
return all the kindness I had shown him.</p>

<p>“I have only my camel and the clothes on my back,” he said. “He
has given me the value of my camel in tobacco.”</p>

<p>It was a cheerful camp at breakfast; the men were pleased with
their gifts, and I enjoyed their satisfaction. After breakfast we
all lay down for a siesta, but got up again promptly, our bodies
itching furiously from the assaults of white ants.</p>

<p>At 5:45 <span class="sc2">P. M.</span> we made our start and
half an hour later emerged from the valley upon the <i>serira</i>.
In front of us lay a chain of hills running east and west, in the
middle of which was Jebel Islingah, and to the right of it Jebel
Agah, to which we were going. Herri said that there was a well also
in Jebel Islingah, but that it was difficult to get at. The valley
where we had camped was marked by trees on the east side of the
entrance to it.</p>

<p>It was a hot day, and we moved slowly for six hours, when we
reached a belt of sand-dunes, which stopped our progress for the
night.</p>

<p><em>Saturday, May 19.</em> We started at 5:15 <span class=
"sc2">A. M.</span> and made our final halt at 8 <span class=
"sc2">P. M.</span> There was a hot northeast wind from the hills,
which dropped in the evening. We traveled over soft sand, very
undulating, covered with dry grass. As we approached the hills the
country became flatter with patches of small black stone.</p>

<p>The sun got hot quickly in the morning, and a hot wind was
blowing, and so we camped at half-past nine in the shade of a
<i>tumtum</i> tree. Its protection was welcome, and its bunches of
red berries made an attractive pattern over our heads.</p>

<p>We started again at 3:30 in spite of the heat, with the hope of
reaching the hills of Agah before dark. The camels had to be beaten
in order to get them away from the shade of the tree and into the
hot sun. By 7:30 we were at the foot of the hills, with the slim
moon just coming up. Mohammed suddenly raised the alarm. He had
found the fresh tracks of two men leading toward Merdi. A stranger
in the desert is an occasion for vigilance until he proves to be
not unfriendly. Rifles were quickly unslung; the oil-rags were
stripped from their breeches, and cartridges shoved in. The men
collected the camels which were scattered out grazing, and
Mohammed, Herri, and Senussi Bu Hassan went forward to the valley
to reconnoiter. After a careful search they came back to report
that there were no tracks leading into the valley but that there
were fresh tracks leading out of it. We made camp at the entrance,
keeping clear of trees and vegetation in case any one approached in
the night. We ate dinner rapidly and extinguished our camp-fire.
The camels and <i>girbas</i> were put in the center of the camp,
and the luggage arranged around its edge. Four sentries were posted
for the night, and we went to bed. But sleep was difficult because
of the oppressive heat and the suspense.</p>

<p>Early on the Sunday morning we got up and approached the valley
cautiously. We came across fresh tracks of sheep and men and were
convinced that some one had a camp in the valley. Mohammed and
Herri went ahead, as the inhabitants of this district were Goran
and no one else spoke their language. They soon returned with three
Gorans. I met them, and we solemnly went through the ceremony of
giving and receiving the <i>aman</i>. We advanced toward each other
and lay whatever weapons we might be carrying, sword or rifle, on
the ground. I addressed them in the time-honored phrases: “I swear
by God that we are peaceful men, that we wish you no harm, and that
we have no intention of robbing you.” One of them did the same in
his turn, and we indulged in brief questions and answers on each
side. Who are you? Whence do you come? Whither are you going? On
what business? Then we shook hands formally, each took up his
weapons, and both sides retired.</p>

<div>
<p>A WELL NEAR KUTTUM IN DARFUR. WOMEN WORKING</p>
</div></div>

<p>We tried to buy sheep from them, but they refused to sell. In a
short time they went away and returned with three sheep which they
offered as <i>diafa</i>, refusing to accept any money for them. I
gave them <i>etkias</i> of blue cloth as a return courtesy, with
which they were delighted. The camels were sent off to the well to
drink and to bring back water for the camp, while the men busied
themselves with preparations for the great feast of meat. In the
afternoon I took photographs and in the evening made observations.
The electric torch which I used in reading the theodolite first
frightened the Goran boys and then delighted them.</p>

<p>The valley of Agah is very picturesque, a long narrow defile
between high cliffs, with more vegetation and trees than we had
seen thus far. Half-way down its length it divides, one branch
leading southwestward to the well and the other southward toward
the open desert. The well is similar to that at Erdi, but its water
is badly fouled by sheep and camels. The valley is full of birds
whose pleasant songs make one think one is at the aviary in the
Zoo.</p>

<p>We were up while it was dark and the stars were still shining in
the clear sky. The Goran came to say good-by. Arami and Hassan had
declined to go further south and left us to return to Ouenat, with
Arami’s camel. We wound our way down the eastern fork of the
valley, its steep sides protecting us from the sun. On the way we
sighted three gazelles, and some of the men gave chase, but the
nimble animals climbed the hills and escaped. Hamid, the Zwayi,
fired at one and missed, to the scornful delight of the others.
Hamid, however, refused to admit complete failure.</p>

<p>“By God,” he stoutly maintained, “I hit it. I saw the blood
spurt.”</p>

<p>It did not matter so much, however, as we still had meat left
from the <i>diafa</i> of the Goran.</p>

<p>It quickly got too hot for comfort, and the camels, fresh from
drinking, refused to go on. We camped in the shade of a tree, but
soon discovered that better protection from the sun was to be had
in crevices in the rocks. The camels were allowed to graze, and the
men settled down to prepare the midday meal. Two sheep were
slaughtered, and their flesh, impaled on sticks, was slowly
revolved before the fire to roast in the Bedouin fashion. It was
delicious. While the meat was being prepared, Sad cut his hand. I
saw the blood and asked where it came from.</p>

<p>“From Hamid’s gazelle!” said Bukara, and once more shouts of
laughter went up over the unsuccessful hunter.</p>

<p>After lunch I wound my watches, recorded the readings of the
aneroid and the maximum and minimum thermometers, and wrote up my
diaries, when Hamid the camelman came running to say that a herd of
ostriches was near-by. We all grasped our rifles and stood ready.
Soon the ostriches appeared, thirty or forty in number. The
Bedouins were impatient and opened fire while the distance was too
great. The ostriches dashed off into another valley with the men in
hot pursuit. Many shots were fired, but Zerwali soon came back to
say that nothing had been killed.</p>

<p>In a little while Hamid appeared carrying a small ostrich and
followed by Senussi Bu Hassan. Both men claimed to have shot the
creature, and since there were two bullet-wounds in it, either of
which might have been fatal, they appealed to me for judgment; I
asked the opinion of the men who saw the shooting, and all agreed
that Hamid’s shot felled the bird. I decided in his favor.</p>

<p>Later Hamid, the camelman, small and sharp of features and
afraid of no animals, not even of snakes, came upon an ostrich in a
closed part of the valley and, after attacking it unsuccessfully
with stones, rushed at it and caught it round the neck. He wrestled
with it manfully, but it landed a kick on his side from one of its
powerful legs and ran away. I was watching the contest through my
binoculars and nearly split my sides with laughter. The ostrich
mounted a ridge, looked back scornfully at Hamid, who stood cursing
it, arranged its feathers, and trotted off with the gait of a gay
dowager, leaving him with his hand pressed to his maltreated
side.</p>

<p>“Has the ostrich hurt you?” I asked solicitously when he
returned.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” he replied, quickly taking his hand from his side.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you bring it back, then?” I asked again.</p>

<p>“I had to let it go,” he explained with great plausibility. “She
was only a female.”</p>

<p>One of my great regrets on this trek was that I was unable to
follow game as I would have liked to. The night marches between
Ouenat and Erdi left me too exhausted in the morning to do anything
but record the readings of my scientific instruments and try to
snatch two or three hours of sleep before it was too hot. Then our
food-supply began to get less and less. I could not stay at Agah
where there were plenty of gazelles, ostriches, and wild sheep.
Besides, the scarcity of water made me lose no time there, where
the well had been so fouled by animals.</p>

<p>An old Egyptian army Martini and an Italian cavalry carbine
which I was given at Kufra, handy as they would have been for
self-defense, were of little use for long-range work on game,
especially gazelle. Hunting, therefore, was a diversion which I had
to deny myself.</p>

</div></div>

<p>It was very hot, and we could not start until 5 <span class=
"sc2">P. M.</span> We followed the lovely valley for an hour and
then began to climb the hills. As we got to the top we had a fine
view of its beauties, all the various shades of green of the trees
and shrubs making picturesque patterns with the rosy sand and the
redder rocks of the hills guarding the valley. The soft notes of
innumerable doves floated up on the cool evening breeze. A gorgeous
red and gold sunset completed an <i>ensemble</i> not easy to
forget. I stopped my horse and spent a pleasant half-hour lying on
a patch of soft sand drinking in the delights of this little bit of
paradise. It soon grew dark. The crescent moon showed herself, and
far away I heard the Bedouins of my caravan singing. Reluctantly I
rose and took the track again.</p>

<p>We were soon in different country, broken and very undulating,
with distant jagged hills surrounding us. The camels were suffering
from the foul water of Agah, and so were the men. We camped early,
both on this account and because it is dangerous country to travel
by the weak moonlight.</p>

<p>We dropped into a soft sand valley about two hundred meters from
our route and camped.</p>

<p>We got up with the stars still in the sky on Tuesday, May 23,
and made our start with a gorgeous sunrise on our left hand. We
moved slowly because of the thick shrubs and scattered stones and
also because Mohammed and Herri had not been in this country for
ten years and were picking their way cautiously.</p>

<p>“Mohammed is riding, I suppose,” I said to Hamid, the camelman,
as I walked in my favorite place behind the caravan, “or we would
not be moving so slowly.”</p>

<p>“The gray-haired man is walking, O bey,” said the shrewd fellow
quickly. “His track is on the ground.”</p>

<p>Once more I was impressed with the keen observation of the
Bedouins, especially the camelman. Hamid had already learned the
characteristic footprints that each man of the caravan leaves. Of
course he knew the track of each camel also.</p>

<p>On Wednesday we were up much earlier than usual in our anxiety
to reach the well of Enebah. The water of Agah was the worst we had
yet tasted, and it was having its effect on both men and camels. A
three hours’ trek brought us to the edge of the valley in which the
well lay. We dropped down into it and discovered from tracks of
sheep, donkeys, and men that the place was inhabited. Mohammed went
forward to meet the men who live there, and gave and received the
<i>aman</i>; and soon we were camped by the well. The water was
excellent; animals and men both enjoyed the change.</p>

<p>There was quite a large Bidiyat camp here, with hundreds of
sheep and a few horses for the <i>sheikhs</i>. Presently the whole
population, led by the <i>sheikhs</i>, came to greet us. I shook
hands with them and distributed scent, putting a little on the hand
of each one.</p>

<p>In the afternoon they brought sheep as <i>diafa</i>, and the
women (who have a keen business sense) produced
<i>samn</i>—butter—and leather to sell to us. We gave them
Medjidies and cloth in exchange. In the evening I took
observations. The Bidiyats were frightened at the theodolite and
the electric torch, and their suspicions were aroused.</p>

<p>One of the <i>sheikhs</i> entered my tent and caught me opening
the instrument-case. I shut the case quickly and instantly realized
my mistake. I could see in his dark cruel face, with yellow eyes
like those of a fox set close together, that he believed I had gold
in the box. As he left my tent I ostentatiously ordered Senussi Bu
Hassan and Hamid to stand as sentries in the camp. I pointed to
them and told the <i>sheikh</i> not to allow the women and children
to approach the camp at night lest my men might make a mistake and
shoot at them. It was just a hint that we were wide-awake and that
there was no hope of catching us off our guard. I could see that
the hint went home.</p>

<h2><a id="chap20"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<p class="sub_chapter">TO FURAWIA ON SHORT RATIONS</p>

<p>The valley of Enebah was covered with soft sand, dotted with
shrubs both green and dry and with trees.</p>

<p>I had a good night’s rest and was awakened by the hubbub of the
Bidiyat women bargaining with the men of my caravan for empty tins.
They offered a kind of dry shrub that they called tobacco and milk
in return. Five more sheep were brought as <i>diafa</i>, and more
presents were distributed.</p>

<p>Encouraged by a cool southeast wind, we started at 3:15
<span class="sc2">P. M.</span>, but the wind soon dropped and we
made slow progress in the heat. The evening was cooler, however,
and we made up a little for lost time. The night was cold.</p>

<p>On <em>Friday, May 25,</em> we were up at four and started an
hour and a quarter later. The country was very undulating and
broken, and Herri was not sure of the way. We moved slowly because
of the difficulty of the going and the uncertainty of the guide.
Shortly after nine we dropped into a valley and camped an hour
later.</p>

<p>Senussi Bu Hassan, who was walking beside me, gave expression to
his opinion of the guide and his Bedouin pride.</p>

<p>“Those Goran wabble about like camels,” he said. “They do not
walk like Bedouins, who fly straight to their goal like birds.”</p>

<p>When we took the road again in the afternoon the sun was still
very hot. The camels moved slowly, and the men’s singing sounded
like broken bagpipes. It was perhaps as well that we were compelled
to move slowly, for Herri was more uncertain of the way than ever.
Some of the time we followed the track left by a flock of sheep
going presumably toward Bao, but at intervals it was lost in the
tracts of broken stones.</p>

<p>A little after five we dropped into a big valley whose name we
discovered later to be Koni-Mina, running east and west and filled
with fine trees. Just before reaching it we met a Goran with a few
sheep. He came up to me, dropped his sword and spears on the
ground, and took off his sandals. We shook hands with many
ejaculations of <i>“Keif-halak, tayi-been”</i> (“How are you? Very
well.”). It was all the Arabic he knew. Mohammed and Herri then
talked with him and learned that there was a Goran camp in the
valley before us. A cattle merchant had also just arrived from Fada
in Wadai with sheep and cows on his way to El Fasher. Mohammed and
Herri left us and approached the few straw-thatched huts that
constituted the Goran camp. We went across the valley and camped on
its farther rim.</p>

<p>Soon a man came running to ask us to return to the camp and
start again the next day. I appreciated the hospitable suggestion
but felt that we could not afford to retrace our steps even for two
or three kilometers. I thanked him for the invitation and told him
that we were in a great hurry. We should camp near-by to wait for
our two guides. An hour later Mohammed appeared, full of news from
Fada and El Fasher, obtained from the merchant.</p>

<p>We were busy that evening overhauling our baggage and repairing
damages. All the ropes were getting worn, and the Bedouin woolen
bags too. We had been losing much time on the way with reloading
and shifting things about. But it was a consolation to know that in
a fortnight we should be in El Fasher.</p>

<p>We had the most beautiful sunrise on May 26 that I have seen.
The brilliant white light on the red and black stones near-by and
the distant hills made everything wonderfully clear and distinct.
Soon it changed to a warm red glow, and then the golden rays of the
sun broke through the thin clouds and flooded everything. The long
shadows cast by rocks and shrubs on the ground looked like black
stenciling on the yellow sand. The shadows of the slowly moving
caravan made a fantastic pattern.</p>

<p>It soon proved to be an oppressively close morning.</p>

<p>Herri joined us later in the forenoon with a slaughtered sheep
slung on each side of his camel, the <i>diafa</i> from the Goran
camp.</p>

<p>We followed sheep and camel tracks and marched from one valley
into another until we camped in one of the largest of them, which
had many shady trees.</p>

<p>It is always a problem whether to stop under the shade of a tree
and suffer the attacks of white ants and all sorts of
sinister-looking insects or pitch tent in the broiling sun. In
future, I shall be inclined to take my chance in the open, as the
insects are always with you, while the sun’s heat is over by five
or six in the afternoon. The valley in which we camped is called
Kap-Terku.</p>

<p>We started again at four, with a southeast breeze that made
walking not so tedious. There were also a few clouds which tempered
the heat of the sun. The camels walked better. In the late
afternoon we passed a Goran family, a man, wife, and naked child,
and later we found a well. It was seven meters deep and had good
water, though the roots of a near-by tree had rotted in it, giving
it an unpleasant odor.</p>

<p>WELL ON THE FRONTIER OF DARFUR</p>
</div></div>

<p>We camped at eight fortunately in a clear space free from shrubs
and stones. At one in the morning a hyena visited the camp, and had
it not been for the vigilance of Hamid, the camelman, it might have
got Baraka, who was tied at night and therefore unable to defend
himself. Hamid fired at it impulsively, and with my glasses I saw a
dark object running far away in the brilliant moonlight.</p>

<p>Herri proved himself a bad guide. He predicted that we would
reach Bao this morning, but when night came we were not yet there.
He knew the places when he saw them, but his sense of direction was
faulty. Our water had given out, except for one last <i>girba</i>,
and it was very hot.</p>

<p>We marched until 7:45, when we reached rocky ground, dangerous
for the camels even in the clear moonlight. We were on the edge of
a large valley which Herri declared to be that of Bao, but we could
not believe him. Experience had taught me not to permit the last of
the water-supply to be used until we had not only seen the well but
approached it to make sure that there was drinkable water there. I
insisted that the last <i>girba</i> should not be touched that
night. We went to bed without dinner, since we could not cook
without water.</p>

<p>There was, however, the consolation of a beautiful night. I lay
in bed watching the play of the moonlight on the clouds. A few
drops of rain announced the approach of the rainy season. We were
astir early. Empty stomachs do not encourage long sleep. We drove
the camels as we had not driven them before. How tired they looked,
and how weak! When camels and men are hungry and thirsty, all the
other defects in the caravan come out. There was no singing that
morning, merely silent, relentless urging forward of the camels and
ourselves.</p>

<p>The descent into the valley was steep and dangerous. Three
camels threw off their loads, which had to be carried by the men
down to the level ground and loaded again. At last we saw a few
sheep and a straw hut or two. We stopped, and I let the men drink
the water from the last <i>girba</i>, for which they had asked many
times that morning.</p>

<p>Herri and Mohammed went ahead and made their way to the huts.
The caravan meanwhile moved directly down the valley toward the
well. Soon some blacks of the Goran and Bidiyat tribes came to meet
us. We fired our rifles as usual, as if in salutation, but in
reality to impress the natives with our preparedness.</p>

<p>I noticed that by a curious coincidence those who met us, men
and women, were all old. There was not a single young person among
them, especially no young woman. However, it did not strike me as
extraordinary, but a little later I was surprised to see batches of
slim and beautiful girls, brown or black, half naked in their
tattered clothes, but holding themselves gracefully erect. As they
came along in groups of three and four, I turned to Bukara and
asked, “From where are these girls?”</p>

<p>Bukara looked at them with great admiration and replied: “Allah
be great! These girls are of the village. They thought we were
going to rob the village and take away the young girls as slaves,
so they sent them out to hide as soon as they sighted our caravan.
Now that the men know that we are a peaceful caravan, they have
sent word to the girls to come back.”</p>

<p>As the girls passed my horse they shyly dropped on their knees
in salutation, as is the custom there when addressing a person of
higher rank. In this part of the world when one is addressed by
some more exalted person the etiquette is not to stand up but to
sit down in token of reverence. One after another these girls
dropped to their knees, and in return I gave them the usual Arab
blessing, “May God’s peace be on you and His mercy and blessings.”
As they rose again the girls bashfully turned to look at my company
of admiring Bedouins.</p>

<p>We camped at the end of the valley near the well. An hour later
the <i>sheikh</i> of the camp came to greet us. We discussed the
roads to El Fasher and the direction to be followed. Here Herri
looked thoughtful and sad. This was close to his own country, for
we were across the frontier of French Wadai now. He had thrown away
his rights and run away from the French, leaving all his property
and relatives, and gone to the solitary oasis of Ouenat to live in
self-inflicted exile.</p>

<p>We were getting into a different kind of country. There were
many more varieties of birds, including crows, owls, parrots,
doves, and others whose names I do not know.</p>

<p>In the night a lioness had killed two donkeys, and some of the
natives captured one of its young and sent its skin to Fada to be
sold. There are several score of blacks of the Goran and Bidiyat
tribes at Bao. The women are graceful creatures, clothed with the
utmost simplicity. Their dress is either a length of cloth wound
skilfully around the body, with a narrow strip of cloth for a belt,
in which is carried a small knife, or a sheepskin wrapped round the
lower part of the body. Their hair is arranged in small plaits.
They wear ornaments of silver and ivory, heavy rings in the hair,
and bead and amber necklaces. Young girls wear only an apron of
cloth or leather. The men have splendid physique, go naked except
for a loin-cloth, and carry two or three spears, a sword, and
throwing-knife. Only <i>sheikhs</i> wear white robes and large
turbans.</p>

<p>We gave the women and children macaroni, but they refused to eat
it. Instead, they threaded the pieces on strings and made
necklaces, which they wore proudly. The business instinct of the
Bedouins at once displayed itself. They made necklaces from our
little store of macaroni and exchanged them for butter and
leather.</p>

<p>Herri and Mohammed were to leave us here. They did not care to
venture further south. I had some difficulty in finding a guide to
take us to Furawia but at last succeeded. A sheep was brought to us
as <i>diafa</i>, and we dined early on Tuesday, intending to make a
prompt start in the morning.</p>

<p>The guide did not present himself, and I began to feel that the
Bidiyat were suspicious of my caravan. At 11 <span class="sc2">P.
M.</span> he appeared, however, and I immediately woke the men and
set them to loading the camels before he had any chance of changing
his mind.</p>

<p>When we started at one o’clock there was a beautiful moon, which
made it as clear as in daylight.</p>

<p>Herri and Mohammed started with us, as they wished to give the
impression to the men of Bao that they were going with us to El
Fasher. Otherwise they feared that they might be waylaid. In an
hour we had climbed out of the valley. We halted to say good-by to
the two guides, who were going to travel only by night on their way
back to Ouenat, to avoid detection.</p>

<p>As I stood a little apart from the caravan in the moment of
farewell to them, I realized that the difficulties through which we
had come had drawn us close together. Mohammed was tall, erect,
with a piercing eye and an interesting illustration of the
self-assurance that life in the desert gives and the fatalistic
resignation with which one accepts whatever comes. Herri was a
gentle-mannered, unassuming old man with a benign smile and
charming manners. There was unquestioned dignity in his movements
in spite of an injured left foot which he had to drag when he
walked. He was a prince by nature.</p>

<p>This was not merely a parting of companions of the trek, but a
symbol of the old, having run the race, pointing the onward road to
the young. We all forgot that I was the head of a caravan and they
my guides. Herri put his hands on my shoulders and spoke with
feeling in his voice.</p>

<p>“May God bless you and give you strength,” he said. “There is
your road.” He pointed to an opening in the distant hills. I
murmured a few words in a voice that I could scarcely trust not to
tremble and turned away to my caravan. The two dignified but
somehow pathetic figures, both exiles from their own land, faded
away in the moonlight.</p>

<p>We halted at dawn for our morning prayers and at 8:30 to camp
for the day. There were tracks of lions about. We started again
early in the afternoon, but the men were tired, having had little
sleep the previous night, and we marched only three hours. The
sheep which had been given us escaped, and in the moonlight Hamid
and Sad went after it, bleating like sheep themselves to attract
it, but with no success.</p>

<p>An uneventful day.</p>

<p>Shortly after an early start on Friday, June 1, the guide got
sleepy and “lost his head.” We were soon traveling due west instead
of southeast. I did not interfere until we stopped for morning
prayers at five, but then I asked him quietly if he had intended to
march to the westward. He was surprised but admitted frankly his
error. Fortunately, we had not been going wrong for long.</p>

<p>At 6:30 we passed a hill called Tamaira, on which stood a dry
tree marking the boundary between Wadai and the Sudan. From the
boundary-post we dropped into Wadai Hawar, a large valley full of
big trees, which is said to extend westward to Wadai and eastward
toward the Sudan. In Wadai, it is called Wadi Hawash.</p>

<p>The soil in the <i>wadi</i> is very fertile, and the men from
Wadai and Darfur come to it in the autumn for grazing. We camped
here for the midday halt and found tracks of giraffe. In the
afternoon we walked through high dry grass as though in a great
field of ripe corn.</p>

<div>
<p>THE CHIEF OF THE ZAGHAWA TRIBE OF DARFUR<br>
Receiving the explorer and his party on entering the frontiers</p>
</div></div>

<p>The men of the caravan were getting worn out, all the more as
clothing was tattered, shoes at the last gasp; and to add to our
inflictions we had much trouble with <i>haskanit</i>, a small, very
hard, hooked thorn which grows on a low bush and attaches itself to
whosoever brushes against it, when it is extremely difficult to
extract.</p>

<p>I heard Bukara describing to Hamid a giraffe and an elephant.
The giraffe, he said, has the head of a camel, the hoofs of a cow,
and the hind quarters of a horse. His word picture of the elephant
was grotesque and much exaggerated, to impress the man from the
north.</p>

<p>We made a very early start on Saturday, June 2, to make sure of
reaching Furawia that day. At 5 <span class="sc2">A. M.</span> we
passed on our right the landmark of Hagar Kamra-ra, ten kilometers
away, and an hour later passed another, Hagar Urdru, a hill about
eighty meters high and two hundred meters long. <i>Hagar</i> is the
Sudanese word for <i>gara</i>, or small hill. Then we started
dropping into the valley of Furawia. It was the largest valley and
the most inhabited that we had come across. Its people are Zaghawa
and a few Bidiyat.</p>

<p>We camped at nine near a Bidiyat camp and soon heard the
distressing news that no food was to be obtained at Furawia. This
was contrary to my expectation. I made haste to find a messenger to
take a letter to the governor of Darfur at El Fasher, asking him to
send me provisions and cloth to clothe my men, who were in rags.
After much hesitation, caused apparently by fear of my men, the
Zaghawa <i>sheikh</i> of a camp near-by came, driven by curiosity,
to visit us. He was under the Sudanese Government, and I pounced on
him and offered him three pounds to take a letter from me to
Saville Pasha, Governor of Darfur. It was liberal pay, and in
addition I threatened him with much unpleasantness should he
hesitate or refuse. I told him he must start at dawn the next day.
After murmuring something about having no animal to carry him, he
went away and soon returned to say that he would take my letter to
El Fasher. He intended to go on horseback. This was good news, for
we had had no sugar for three weeks and had been obliged to sweeten
our tea as best we could with pounded-up dates. Flour and rice had
also given out, and a scanty diet of macaroni prepared with bad
water is very monotonous.</p>

<p>I moved the camp near to one of the wells in the valley and
tried to buy a sheep to cheer up my men. But it was getting dark,
and none of the inhabitants came near our camp. We watered the
camels and settled down for the night, not very well satisfied with
life.</p>

<p>I was suddenly surprised to hear my men singing and apparently
as cheerful as though they had had a good meal. I called Zerwali
and Bukara over and asked them what was the singing about when
there was no sugar and little food and things were generally
disagreeable.</p>

<p>“We can breathe now,” answered Zerwali. “We have entered the
Sudan and feel ourselves at last in safety.”</p>

<p>“Were you so fearful, then, of this journey we have made?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“At Kufra all our relations said that we were ‘walking for our
fate’ when we took this road,” explained Bukara. “‘Your fates are
written,’ they said to us, ‘but may God protect you.’ We wondered
if perhaps they might not be right.”</p>

<p>“You heard at Kufra,” said Zerwali, “how some people offered you
encouragement to take this route, while many advised against it.
Those who favored it were malicious men who simply hoped that they
would never see you again.”</p>

<p>It was then also that Zerwali—who, now that we were nearing the
end of the trip, felt himself more free to talk—told me that the
houses of Sadaida and Jehilat of the Zwaya tribe at Hawari and
Kufra had strongly resented my second visit and held a meeting to
discuss the best means of either destroying the caravan or
preventing me from coming back.</p>

<p>Then I realized what pluck it had taken for these men to come
with me by the strange and unknown way without a murmur of protest.
I was proud of them.</p>

<p>At 2 <span class="sc2">A. M.</span> Hamid, who was acting as
sentry, woke me to say that the messenger had arrived and was ready
to take my letter to El Fasher. Two letters were all written and
ready under my pillow, one to Saville Pasha and the other to the
officer in command at Kuttum, the outpost on the way to El Fasher,
asking him to make sure that my letter to El Fasher reached its
destination. I was glad the messenger had come so early. The sooner
we got new supplies the happier we should all be. I promised him a
few extra dollars if he would deliver the letter to El Fasher in
four days. I bade him a very warm God-speed and watched him ride
off in the moonlight on a quite strong if ragged-looking horse.</p>

<h2><a id="chap21"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<p class="sub_chapter">JOURNEY’S END</p>

<p>Sleep came slowly to me that first night at Furawia. I was
excited as I had not been since saying good-by to Lieutenant Bather
at Sollum and beginning the journey. Now I was in touch again with
the outside world and the journey was really over, even though it
would still be a month or more before I should exchange my caravan
for other methods of travel. The “lost” oases of Arkenu and Ouenat
were no longer lost, and, if my observations proved to be as
accurate as I hoped they were, a good map could now be made of this
strip of the Libyan Desert from Jalo to Furawia.</p>

<p>We spent three full days at Furawia getting used to the damp
climate we had come into and trying to get enough to eat to keep us
from feeling miserable. Dark clouds hovered over our heads much of
the time, and every day it rained. My men gorged themselves with
mutton, but the lack of sugar for the tea and other provisions
rather took the edge off their enjoyment of these feasts.</p>

<p>On June 6 we started south in the afternoon and climbed slowly
out of the valley. We passed many flocks of sheep and cattle going
home, followed by slim girls and boys clad in nothing but a
loin-cloth or strings of beads.</p>

<p>It was quite different from the desert we had come through. We
were following a beaten track and passing frequently small villages
of straw huts, women carrying <i>hatab</i>, and other signs of
habitation.</p>

<p>Near one of the villages I told the caravan to go ahead and
pointed out to them where we would camp. I followed with my horse.
There were a few points of interest geographically, and I had to
take some observations. As I was nearing the camp I heard voices
curiously upraised, a mixture between men wailing and singing. My
first thought was that some of the men of the caravan had got into
trouble with the natives. I spurred on my horse and as I was
approaching the camp my mind was relieved, for I heard the
<i>tom-tom</i> of the drum and women’s voices singing. It was just
after sunset, and in the dusk I could not distinguish clearly the
crowd that was moving toward me, but soon one of my men came
rushing up to tell me they had had the most cordial reception from
the men and women of the village, who insisted on coming out to
receive “the <i>sheikh</i> of the caravan.” He had hardly broken
this news to me when a bevy of young girls, some singing, others
dancing, surrounded my horse, who responded as befitted a Bedouin
horse and started prancing. The women raised <i>lu-lias</i>, and I
was urged by my Bedouins to empty gunpowder. The crowd made way for
my horse, and I walked him a short distance off, turned around,
came rushing back, and pulled him up dead. By that time I had got
out my rifle, and as my horse stopped dead I fired my shot, in
Bedouin fashion, at the feet of the first row of beautiful damsels.
They were half frightened and half delighted. Then six of them
surrounded the horse, circling round me, and gave me the
<i>shabaal</i>; that is to say, with a sudden twist of the head
they whirled their tresses toward me as a woman of southern Europe
might throw a rose. In response, I put my finger on each girl’s
forehead and, holding my rifle high in the air, twirled it round
her head, crying <i>“Abshir bil kheir!”</i> (“Rejoice in the bounty
of God!”). We then formed ourselves into a procession and proceeded
to the camp. The moment they saw me coming surrounded by all those
girls the Bedouins fired in the air in honor of the occasion. The
Bedouin is very chivalrous, and such is his idea of honoring the
ladies. Afterward I distributed scent to all the girls, who went
away very happy, and it was a most cheerful evening in the
camp.</p>

<p>The next day we reached Um Buru, thirty-eight kilometers from
Furawia. We camped near the well, and the next morning I was
awakened early by sounds of cattle and sheep coming to water. An
hour later a busy market was being held alongside our camp. We had
unwittingly pitched our tents close by the big tree that marked the
center of the marketplace. Only women took part in the market,
bringing butter, leather, mats, maize, cotton, and salt, which they
bartered with each other without the use of money. Meanwhile the
men lay about at their ease and did nothing. As I watched such a
scene as this and others not unlike in the villages of the Sudan, I
found myself wondering whether the black women were not after all
better off as slaves in a Bedouin household. Here they do all the
work that is done, caring for cattle and sheep, doing the
housework, and preparing meals and making the favorite beverage
<i>merissa</i> for their men, carrying on the business of the
market—everything. As slaves they would have only certain
circumscribed duties and some opportunity for leisure. As I turned
this over in my mind, however, I seemed to catch something in the
sound of their talk and their laughter that slaves do not have.
Perhaps there is something in the feeling of liberty after all,
even when it is accompanied by drudgery.</p>

<div>
<p>THE RECEPTION OF THE EXPLORER AT EL FASHER<br>
The governor of the Darfur Province and his staff welcome the
explorer to the capital of the province</p>
</div></div>

<p>We stopped at Um Buru for two days. Abdel Rahman Jeddu,
<i>wakil</i> of Mohammedin, the head of the Zaghawa tribe, visited
me and brought sheep and chicken as <i>diafa</i>. On the second day
we were given an official welcome, the <i>wakil</i> coming with a
retinue of retainers on horseback beating drums. Mohammedin’s
family, in the absence of the master of the household, sent a lunch
of <i>asida</i>, vegetables, <i>merissa</i>, and pastry.</p>

<p>The next stage of our journey was a five days’ trek to Kuttum,
129 kilometers to the southward. The weather was generally good,
though hot, with an occasional shower. We traveled as usual in the
early morning and late afternoon. There was a beaten track with
fairly good going, through hilly country covered with dry grass and
small trees. At intervals there were patches which had been burnt
in preparation for being cultivated.</p>

<p>On the third day my messenger to El Fasher arrived, with two
companions, but it was a disappointing meeting. It had taken him
five days instead of four to reach his destination, and he had not
brought the answer to my letter back with him. It was waiting for
me, he said, in the possession of a soldier at Mutarrig Well,
twelve hours’ journey from where we were. The soldier also had
provisions for us, but they did us little immediate good at that
distance.</p>

<p>There was little for dinner when we camped that night. After
dinner I sent our guide off post-haste with orders to ride all
night and until he reached Mutarrig. There he was to tell the
soldier to come to us as fast as he could.</p>

<p>We started before four the next morning, and in an hour the men
came rushing to me with the news that there was a soldier ahead on
a camel. In a few minutes I had a letter from Charles Dupuis,
acting Governor of Darfur, in the absence of Saville Pasha who had
resigned from the service, and a small supply of rice, flour, tea,
and sugar. I was especially pleased to be handed a supply of
cigarettes.</p>

<p>I had not smoked since soon after leaving Erdi. At Ouenat I had
suddenly realized that there were only a few cigarettes left. I
then laid down a strict rule for myself: one cigarette a day after
dinner. It was hard work waiting all day for that brief smoke, but
it was worth it when the moment came. I would get into a sheltered
corner, light the precious cigarette, and shield it carefully from
any breath of wind that might make it burn ever so slightly faster.
When the few cigarettes were gone, there was nothing left but
memories and expectation. Now at last the expectation was gratified
with a vengeance, for I smoked until my throat was sore.</p>

<p>Bukara, with a handful of the newly arrived cigarettes, put on
his long-tasseled red <i>tarboosh</i>, got on the guide’s horse,
and did a little <i>fantasia</i> of joy. But it was when we camped
at the government rest-house at Marahig that general rejoicing
broke loose with singing and dancing. The corporal, looking on
while the men set the sugar-loaf on the ground and executed a wild
dance about it, thought us all a little mad.</p>

<p>“Why all this rejoicing?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Because for a month we have had no sugar, and now our tea is
sweetened again,” said Abdullahi.</p>

<p>Until one has tried going without any sugar whatever, one does
not realize how keenly it will be missed.</p>

<p>The corporal shook his head and smiled. “I must return at once
to Kuttum and bring you more provisions,” he said. “We never
realized that you were so short of food.” Before he left he was
kind enough to go to a camp near-by and bring us a sheep and
butter, which were to be paid for by the <i>moawin</i> of Kuttum,
since the seller refused to accept Egyptian paper money. The
corporal then left with letters from me for Mr. Dupuis and the
<i>moawin</i>, the deputy Governor of Kuttum.</p>

<p>The provisions which he had brought us were good as far as they
went, but we should very soon be in need of more. I decided to push
on at once. We made our midday halt at the government rest-house at
Marahig Well and our stop for the night only a few kilometers
farther on. The camels were in very bad condition. The backs and
sides of some of them were sore and bleeding, and two camels
refused to move until their loads were taken off. It rained for an
hour that evening, but it could not dampen our spirits. The men
sang and danced around a big fire. The humidity and the smell of
the wet grass reminded me of my walks in English country.</p>

<p>We made an early start the next morning in order to reach
Mutarrig Well for the midday halt. We lunched at the rest-house
near the well and received a visit from the <i>sheikh</i> of
Mutarrig, who brought a few chickens as <i>diafa</i>. He wanted us
to stop the night so that he could entertain us properly the next
day, but I felt the necessity of going on as fast as possible.</p>

<p>The camels were getting steadily worse. We had to leave one of
them with the <i>sheikh</i> of the village on the understanding
that if it recovered he was to get a quarter of the price it
brought when sold, while if it died he was not to be held
responsible.</p>

<p>An hour and a half after starting the next day another soldier
on horseback appeared. He brought a letter from the <i>moawin</i>
of Kuttum and a small quantity of rice and sugar. They are
gratefully received, for once more we were on short rations and
without sugar for our tea. I gave him a letter to take back to
Kuttum. A little later we camped in the small valley of Boa. In the
afternoon, soon after we had started again, it came on to rain with
a strong southeast wind, and I thought it might be wise to camp
until the storm was over. But through my glasses I made out ahead
of us the row of straw huts of the Markas—the government house—of
Kuttum, and spurred on by the sight we drove the camels faster.</p>

<p>Soon a group of horsemen were seen approaching us, and my
Bedouins impulsively raised a cheer. When I recognized the uniform
of Sudanese troops, it was the most cheering sight that I had seen
for many weeks. Riad Abu Akla Effendi and Nasr El Din Shaddad
Effendi, the two <i>moawins</i> of Kuttum, approached with a
detachment of ten soldiers, the <i>kadi</i>, the head clerk, and
other officials and notables of Kuttum. I shook hands warmly with
them all, and under their escort the caravan moved on through the
village. As we approached, the Markas women clothed in white and
beating drums greeted us with singing and “lu-lias.” We settled
ourselves in and about the rest-house, and the women came again to
offer greetings. In a long line they sang and danced, much to the
delight of my Bedouins, who asked permission to empty gunpowder in
acknowledgment of the courtesy. I could not refuse my consent, and
one by one, beginning with Bukara, the men performed the ceremony
of singeing the girls’ slippers. The Sudanese women were not so
accustomed to the Bedouin manner of paying homage as the girls of
the northern desert, and flinched a little as the powder flashed at
their feet. But they accepted it all in good part, the whole line
swaying and dancing to the rhythm of the drums while one by one my
men singled them out for the “slipper-singeing honor.” It was a
wonderful reception, and the pleasure of it dispersed like magic
the fatigue and lassitude of the journey.</p>

<p>More hospitality was to come. Four sheep, butter, and fresh
vegetables, to say nothing of sugar, were brought to us as
<i>diafa</i> from the <i>moawins</i> and officials, and we spent a
pleasant evening feasting.</p>

<p>Our arrival at Kuttum at this particular moment had seemed to
the inhabitants there an especially auspicious one, for we came
with the first rain of the season.</p>

<p>We stopped there for two days, entertained generously by the
<i>moawins</i> in the absence of the inspector, Mr. Arkell, who was
at El Fasher.</p>

<p>One afternoon we attended a soccer match between two teams of
soldiers. It was played with energy if not with finesse. At times a
player, striving to give the ball an especially vigorous kick,
would miss it and send his Sudanese slipper shooting high into the
air. The <i>camaraderie</i> between officers and men, playing this
not exactly gentle game together, was interesting to see.</p>

<p>Dinner that night with Riad Effendi and Nasr El Din Effendi, the
<i>moawins</i>, was the first meal I had eaten in a house since
leaving Kufra. My hosts gave me Egyptian newspapers to read, the
first I had seen in nearly six months.</p>

<p>We left Kuttum at six o’clock on the morning of June 17, cheered
by the generous hospitality we had enjoyed and the friendly
send-off our friends gave us. The two days’ journey to El Fasher
was a joy-ride. We all felt the thrill and exhilaration of getting
in touch with the world again.</p>

<p>But as I went to bed on the eighteenth I realized with a stab of
regret that this was my last day in the real desert. I thought how
I should miss my men and my camels, the desolateness and the
beauty, the solitude and the companionship; in two words, the
desert and its life. I thanked God for His guidance across this
vast expanse of pathless sand and found myself adding a prayer,
half wistfully, that I might come back to it again.</p>

<p>I had given orders for an early start the next morning. In their
eagerness my men somewhat exaggerated my idea of “early,” but I was
excited myself and did not mind getting under way at half-past
two.</p>

<p>Three hours’ march from El Fasher we camped to make preparations
for entering the place. We all shaved and put on our best clothes.
Mr. Dupuis had sent a supply of white cloth to Kuttum for us, and
my men were able to appear once more in decent raiment. They
crowded around my remnant of a mirror to see how they looked.
Rifles were cleaned, and the luggage, which was in a very shabby
state, was tidied as much as possible. I wished that I might be
able to do something for the camels as well, which were thin and
dejected-looking. But rest and attention to their sore backs were
what they needed, and we had no time or facilities for giving them
that. Nevertheless they too seemed to be infected with the spirit
of eagerness felt by all of us and walked forward briskly.
Abdullahi and Zerwali got into their silks, and the caravan moved
gaily toward its destination.</p>

<p>As we reached the outskirts of El Fasher, cheers of rejoicing
rose throughout the caravan. A cavalcade of men in khaki was coming
toward us. I put spurs to Baraka, and he responded willingly. He
saw the horses before us, pricked his ears forward, and dashed
toward them.</p>

<div>
<p>EL FASHER<br>

</div></div>

<p>Mr. Dupuis came forward on his horse to meet me, and we shook
hands warmly. The greetings were repeated by the English and
Egyptian officers of his staff, and we went on to his house, a part
of which he generously made over to me and the men of my caravan.
The weary camels were promptly taken in hand by Bimbashi Andas, who
gave them food, water, and the medical treatment for their wounds
they so much needed.</p>

<p>The officer in charge of the wireless station kindly got me the
exact Greenwich time from Paris by radio. I was pleased to discover
that my chronometer had lost only twenty-three minutes and
twenty-three seconds in eight months.</p>

<p>For ten days I was the guest of Mr. Dupuis and was lavishly
entertained by the officers and officials of the garrison, both
English and my own compatriots, and the notables of the town.
Hospitality was showered upon me, and every kind of assistance that
could possibly be needed was eagerly rendered. This was
civilization again. I enjoyed once more the luxuries of life,
especially vegetables and fruits. It is only when one has gone
through the austere régime of the desert that one looks upon these
things as luxuries and not necessities. There was in particular a
brand of prunes, the pride of Major Smith, and of peculiar
lusciousness. He called them “If Winter Comes,” and I have never
tasted their like anywhere.</p>

<p>At last the day came when I must take leave of my companions of
the trek from Kufra. When Bukara and his brother and Hamid and
Senussi Bu Jaber came to my room to say good-by, it was a moment
full of real emotion and crowded with memories. These rugged men of
the desert burst into tears, and I found my own eyes wet. We had
been through thick and thin together and came out fast friends. I
could never wish for better companions on a journey into desolate
regions, more able, more manly, or more loyal.</p>

<p>We read the “Fat-ha,” the sound of the familiar sacred phrases
punctuated by Bukara’s sobbing. I exchanged a final handclasp with
each of them, and we parted, to meet one day, I hope, in that
desert that I love as much as they.</p>

<p>One more camel-trek before me eastward to El Obeid. There I took
train for Khartum and thence home to Cairo, where I arrived on
August 1, 1923.</p>

<p>I had been away from home seven months and twenty-three days,
having trekked twenty-two hundred miles across the desert by
caravan.</p>

<p>I had determined finally the position of the Zieghen Wells and
of Kufra on the map of Africa, in the placing of which there had
been hitherto errors of one hundred and of forty-five kilometers
respectively.</p>

<p>I had also had the great good fortune to put the “lost” oases of
Arkenu and Ouenat definitely on the map of the Libyan Desert.</p>

<p class="sc center">Note on the Cartographical Results of
Hassanein Bey’s Journey</p>

<p class="center">John Ball, O.B.E., D.Sc., Director of Desert
Surveys, Egypt</p>

<p class="app_section">1. Introduction</p>

<p>The cartographical data brought back by Hassanein Bey consist
of:</p>

<p>(1) Note-books containing the records of astronomical
observations for the determination of time, latitude, and
compass-variation at nineteen principal camps, with records of
watch-comparisons.</p>

<p>(2) A journal giving a continuous record of observed
compass-bearings and estimated distances from Siwa Oasis to Lameina
Wells, near El Fasher, a distance of about 2430 kilometers.</p>

<p>The journal also contains a considerable number of observed
compass-bearings to conspicuous features on either side of the
route, with a few rough trigonometrical estimations of the
altitudes of mountains passed, a large number of readings of an
aneroid barometer and sling thermometer for the estimation of
altitudes along the route, daily observations of maximum and
minimum temperatures, observations on the character of the country
passed through, and notes on the meteorological conditions.</p>

<p>These observational data have been reduced in the Desert Survey
Office, Cairo, and utilized in the preparation of the map on a
scale of 1:2,000,000 which accompanies Hassanein Bey’s account of
his travels. The objects of the present note are, first, to give an
account of the critical examination to which the records were
subjected in the course of the reduction of the observations, so as
to enable an estimate to be formed of the degree of precision which
may be fairly assigned to the geographical positions, altitudes,
and other results used in the construction of the map; and,
secondly, to indicate the additions to existing geographical
knowledge concerning a little-known region of northeast Africa
which have accrued from the expedition.</p>

<p class="app_section">2. Astronomical Determination of Local
Time</p>

<p>Theodolite observations of altitudes of the sun or of stars were
made at all the principal camps for determining the error on local
mean time of the half-chronometer watch which was used in the
latitude observations. In all, thirty-four complete time
determinations were made at seventeen camps. The observations were
made with a three-inch Troughton & Simms theodolite, the vertical
circle of which could be read by two verniers to 1′, and which was
provided with a sensitive level on the microscope arm. The
theodolite was invariably set up in the magnetic meridian by its
trough compass, and the method used was to note the times of
passage of the sun’s limb or of the star over each of the three
horizontal wires of the stadia-graticule, reading the level and
circle at each pointing, face-right and face-left. In the case of
stars, the magnetic bearing of the star was also noted from the
horizontal circle, and a note made of the color and brightness of
the star, for the identification of the stars subsequently in the
office, and thus to free the observer from the necessity of knowing
the stars’ names. The barometer and thermometer were carefully read
at each observation for calculating the refraction.</p>

<p>No difficulty was experienced in subsequently identifying the
stars. In only a single case was it found necessary to reject an
observation, and this because the observer had accidentally sighted
different stars on the two faces of the instrument. On many days
two or more observations were taken at the same place, and
comparisons of the results at these places indicated that the
observations are remarkably accurate for so small an instrument. In
seven cases where the sun has been observed shortly before sunset
and a star soon after sunset, for example, the maximum difference
between the results given by the two observations is only seven
seconds, while the average is under four seconds. It is thus
apparent that the precision of the time observations is amply
sufficient to insure that no sensible error in the latitudes can be
due to errors of the adopted local times.</p>

<p>As the only use made of the time observations in the preparation
of the map has been in the determination of latitude, it would
serve no useful purpose to give a list of the watch errors. But it
may interest future geographers, undertaking long desert journeys,
to note some of Hassanein Bey’s experiences in the transport of
watches, and the hazard of relying on constancy of rate for long
periods with even the best watch.</p>

<p>Of the six watches carried, only a single one remained in going
order throughout the journey. The timekeeper which thus
successfully resisted the vicissitudes of the seven months of
desert travel was fortunately the one with which Hassanein Bey took
all his observations, and was carried in his pocket during the
entire journey; it was a large-sized half-chronometer “explorer’s”
watch of English manufacture, with a dust-proof cap to the winding
mechanism. It had been awarded an “especially good” certificate at
the National Physical Laboratory of England, and was consequently
the most expensive of all the six watches taken on the journey.
Even this watch failed to maintain a sufficiently constant rate to
be of any service in the determination of longitudes, though it
amply sufficed for the latitudes, even in two cases when reliance
had to be placed on the constancy of its rate for one or two days
owing to latitude alone being observed without corresponding
observations for local time. Thus, for instance, the following were
the average rates of the principal watch deduced from local time
observations at places of previously known latitudes:</p>

</table>

<p>The above table fails, however, to bring out fully the actual
variations of the watch. So long as the other five watches remained
in order, Hassanein Bey made frequent comparisons with his
principal watch, and between March 21 and 23 there is strong
evidence that the principal watch made an abnormal gain of about
fifty seconds. A similar abnormal gain of twenty-nine seconds by
the principal watch is evidenced in the twenty-four hours between
comparisons of March 24 and 25. Both these abnormalities occurred
between Jalo and El Harrash, at an early stage of the journey,
while all the watches appeared to be behaving tolerably well, and
it is quite possible that other abnormalities occurred at later
stages, when, owing to some or all of the other watches having
stopped or broken down, no satisfactory control by comparison was
possible.</p>

<p>Of the other five watches carried, one was an English
half-chronometer, similar to the principal watch but of smaller
size; three were high-class Swiss lever (“Peerless”) watches with
very tight-fitting cases; and the fifth was a small Swiss
lever-watch with luminous dial, carried on the wrist for noting the
times of marching. The small half-chronometer stopped on April 3,
after going for over four months; and though it was restarted, its
rate changed considerably after the stoppage. The three “Peerless”
watches, though they failed to continue going to the end of the
journey, showed by no means a bad record. One was found stopping
and unreliable on May 6, after going for over five months; the two
others continued to go for over a month longer; and so far as can
be judged from the comparisons made on the route, their variations
of rate were about of the same order as those of the
half-chronometers. The wrist-watch, from the manner in which it was
carried, was of course liable to much greater variations of rate,
and was occasionally reset by the principal watch; but it kept
going till nearly the end of the journey.</p>

<p>As regards dust-resisting power, which must always be one of the
principal aims in selection of watches for desert exploration,
there appears to be nothing to choose between good English
half-chronometers and the highest class of Swiss watches, the cases
of the latter being remarkably close-fitting. The most probable
cause either of stoppage or of abnormal changes of rate appears to
be the sudden shocks which may arise either to a watch carried on
the person when jumping on or off a camel, or to one carried in the
baggage by sudden movements of the camel. The most likely
explanation of the abnormal gains of the principal watch for short
periods on the two occasions above noted would seem to be that,
owing to a jerk in mounting or dismounting, two contiguous coils of
the hairspring may have been made to touch each other for a short
time, with consequent temporary shortening of the period of
vibration of the balance-wheel. It is noteworthy that the watch
which remained going throughout the journey was the largest of all
those taken, and its greater resisting-power may have been to some
extent due to its size, permitting of greater strength in its
component parts.</p>

<p class="app_section">3. Astronomical Determinations of
Latitude</p>

<p>Observations for latitude by altitudes of the pole-star were
carried out on thirty-five nights at nineteen principal camps,
using the same three-inch theodolite as was employed for the
time-observations. Three readings of altitude were made on each
face, using each of the three horizontal stadia-wires in turn, the
corresponding times being noted on a half-chronometer watch whose
error on local time was accurately known from sun or
star-observations carried out just before the latitude-observation.
Particular care was taken with the level-adjustment, and the
air-pressure and temperature at the time of the observation were
recorded.</p>

<p>Of six of the above places (Sollum, Siwa, Jaghbub, Kuttum, El
Fasher, and El Obeid) the latitudes are accurately known from the
Egyptian and Sudan official surveys, and the agreement in these
cases is very satisfactory, though a very close comparison is not
generally possible owing to uncertainty as to Hassanein Bey’s
precise observation-spot. At Jaghbub, Hassanein Bey records that
his observation-spot was 200 meters S.S.W. of the dome of the
mosque. Applying the corresponding difference of latitude (-6″) to
my own determination of the latitude of the dome in 1917 (29° 44′
41″) we obtain 29° 44′ 35″, showing a difference of only 9″ from
Hassanein Bey’s observed latitude.</p>

<p>A further test of the degree of precision of the
latitude-observations can be made by comparison of the latitudes
found for the same camp by observations taken on different nights.
The following gives the average deviation of a single observed
latitude from the mean at all the camps where two or more
observations for latitude were made:</p>

<p>It thus appears unlikely that any observed latitude can be as
much as 1′ in error, and consequently in the preparation of the
map, Hassanein Bey’s observed latitudes have been accepted as
fundamental data for all the places for which no previous
determinations are known to exist, viz., El Harrash, Taj, Arkenu,
Ouenat, Erdi, Agah, Enebah, and Bao. His latitudes for Jalo (El
Erg), Bir Buttafal, and Furawia have also been adopted for the map,
the first because it is possibly better than that of Rohlfs, with
whose mapped position it is however in very close agreement; the
second because while differing by about 2′ from Rohlfs’s value (28°
36′ 22″) it is doubtless more exact, because it checks admirably
well with Hassanein Bey’s dead reckoning; and the third because,
although the position of Furawia is shown on the Sudan maps, it is
outside the present limits of the Sudan triangulation and is
possibly liable to some slight error.<a id=

<p class="app_section">4. Observations of Compass-Variations</p>

<p>For finding the pole-star easily when the sky was not very dark
or was partially obscured by clouds, and also for obtaining the
approximate bearings of time-stars for their subsequent
identification, the theodolite was invariably set up in the
magnetic meridian by its trough-compass, and the magnetic bearing
of the pole-star was read on the horizontal circle after each
latitude-observation and the time noted. In this way approximate
compass-variation was determined at each camp, with the following

<p>The method of estimating the compass-variation with the
theodolite is, of course, only rough; but the values found are
probably correct at most places within half a degree, and they
serve to show that there is no likelihood of any serious errors of
dead-reckoning owing to local irregularities of the
compass-variation. They have accordingly been utilized in reduction
of the compass-bearings of the traverse to true bearings over the
major portion of the route, where no previous determinations exist,
and where in consequence the distribution of the isogonic lines is
not known with any exactitude.</p>

<p class="app_section">5. Longitudes</p>

<p>The probability of some watches breaking in the course of seven
months’ travel had been foreseen, and from the outset it appeared
improbable that any use could be made of the watches in the direct
determination of longitude of so long and difficult a journey. We
had decided accordingly to depend ultimately on dead-reckoning for
longitude, making every effort to obtain an unbroken chain of
compass-bearings and estimated distances between Jaghbub and some
known place in the Sudan, the bearings to be taken with a good
compass with all possible precision, at very frequent intervals,
and the estimates of distance to be carefully made each day from
the marching time of the baggage-camels, assuming a normal rate of
4 km. per hour over average desert, and making allowance for the
variations in speed over ground of varying character. The journey
being predominantly north to south, the estimates of distance could
mostly be well controlled by the latitudes, while errors of bearing
would not be cumulative, and would tend to cancel out over any
considerable stretch of route. The primary reason for taking six
watches was therefore not to determine longitude, for which at best
they could afford only somewhat uncertain values, but to make sure
of at least one watch being available throughout the journey for
latitude-observations, without which no proper control of the
all-important distances could be obtained.</p>

<p>The doubts about the possibility of safely transporting the
watches proved justified, for all but one broke down before the end
of the journey. But fortunately on the one hand the watch which
survived sufficed amply for the determination of latitude (though
its rate was insufficiently constant for it to be used uncontrolled
in finding longitudes), and on the other hand the program of a
continuous chain of very careful bearings and estimation of
distances was scrupulously adhered to from the departure of the
caravan from Jaghbub, the last known place in Egypt, to Furawia,
the first known place in the Sudan—a journey of 2430 kilometers—and
from this chain of bearings and estimated distances, combined with
the observed latitudes, it was possible to estimate the longitudes
of all places on the route with a fairly high probability of
accuracy.</p>

<p>For the estimation of the longitude of Jalo (El Erg) a slightly
different procedure was followed from that adopted for the other
principal camps on the route. It will be noticed from the map that
the general direction of the march from Jaghbub to Jalo was
predominantly from east to west, instead of from north to south as
in the rest of the journey. Consequently the observed latitudes do
not afford so good a means of correcting the estimated distances in
this stretch as elsewhere. But fortunately the observed latitude at
Jalo does enable us to correct the previous estimation by Hassanein
Bey (in 1920) of the distance of that place from Jedabia, and this
combined with the then observed bearings would lead to one value
for the longitude <a id="Page_320"></a>for Jalo, while if we can
assume the accuracy of the estimated distances from Jaghbub to
Jalo, we may use the observed latitude of the latter place to
correct the bearings and thus arrive at another value for its
longitude.</p>

<p>From careful consideration of all the available data, the two
methods appear likely to be about equal in degree of approximation.
The position at present accepted for Jedabia (Lat. 30° 48′ 10″ N.,
Long. 20° 13′ 30″ E.) is open to a little uncertainty,<a id=
"FNanchor_02"></a><a href="#Footnote_02" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
and the bearings taken by Hassanein Bey on his former expedition
are probably a little less accurate than those of the present one.
On the other hand, the estimations of the distances from Jaghbub to
Jalo, as gaged by the latitude-control of the other portions of the
route of the present expedition, are remarkably close to the truth,
while a uniform correction to his bearings of less than half a
degree would swing his dead-reckoning position for Jalo on to its
observed parallel of latitude.</p>

<p>For the longitude of Jalo on the map I have therefore taken the
mean of the two longitudes found (1) by assuming Hassanein Bey’s
bearings correct from Jedabia and correcting his distances by the
latitudes, and (2) by assuming his distances from Jaghbub correct
and using the observed latitudes to correct his bearings. The
results are:</p>

along the route, the procedure has been as follows. The route was
divided into the following nine sections between principal camps
where latitudes had been observed: Jalo, El Harrash, Taj, Arkenu,
Ouenat, Erdi, Agah, Enebah, Bao, Furawia; and the compass-traverse
for each section was plotted on a scale of 1:500,000 from the
recorded bearings and estimated distances. A true meridian was then
drawn on each section from the mean of the observed
compass-variations at its two ends, and the total difference of
latitude of each section was scaled off and compared with the
difference of latitude given by the latitude-observations. This
comparison gave, of course, the average error of estimation of
distance along each section, assuming the bearings correct. The
results of the comparison for the various sections are tabulated
below:</p>

<p>The average error of distance-estimation in each section of the
route having been thus found, the next step was to scale off the
various departures from the plotted traverses, correcting for the
errors of distance-estimation, and then to convert the departures
into differences of longitude. When this was done, the resulting
total difference of longitude between Jalo and Furawia was 2° 25′
55″. But assuming the true longitude of Jalo to be that found
above, and the true longitude of Furawia to be as shown on sheet 53

<p>In attempting to estimate the probable degree of accuracy of the
concluded longitudes, we are faced with the difficulty that while
we may be certain that the average error of the compass-bearings
was less than 1°, which average error has been allowed for in the
adjustment, we have no proof that in some of the individual
sections the errors may not have been considerably greater. But in
view of the great number of the observed compass-bearings (339)
which make up the directional data of the 1754 kilometers of
traverse from Jalo to Furawia (an average of thirty-eight observed
bearings for each of the nine sections), and bearing in mind also
the remarkable accuracy of the estimations of distance as evidenced
by the latitude-observations, it would seem unlikely that any of
the above-adopted longitudes for the principal camps can be in
error by more than three or four miles. This implies a degree of
accuracy which it would have been difficult to insure by transport
of even a considerable number of chronometers over a land journey
lasting more than three months. It may, I think, be concluded that
no better values for the longitudes can be obtained without the aid
of wireless time-signals.</p>

<p class="app_section">6. Altitudes above Sea-level</p>

<p>For the barometric estimations of altitudes above sea-level, a
two-inch aneroid by Steward was used. This instrument, which was
one of two specially made for the expedition, was very carefully
compensated for temperature, and provided with a fairly open
pressure-scale, a millimeter of pressure being represented by very
nearly a millimeter of actual scale-length, so that estimations to
half-millimeters of pressure could be readily made.</p>

<p>The aneroid was read morning and evening at each camp, and at
numerous other points on the route, the air-temperatures being as a
rule recorded at the same time, as given by sling-thermometer. The
aneroid behaved very satisfactorily throughout the journey. There
had unfortunately been no opportunity of testing the instrument
before Hassanein Bey’s departure, but it was in perfect order on
his return, and was then tested in the laboratory of the Physical
Department at Cairo, when it was found to require the following
corrections (at about 25° C.):</p>

<p>That the above corrections had remained sensibly constant
throughout the journey is rendered extremely probable by the close
agreement noted further on <a href="#Page_329">(p. 329)</a> between
the levels found for Jalo directly from the aneroid readings
(corrected, of course, on the assumption of constancy of the table)
and those found indirectly from readings of the mercurial barometer
in the meteorological station at Siwa.</p>

<p>The first step in the calculation of the barometric levels was
to collect the whole of the readings of the barometer and
sling-thermometer at each of the nine principal camps, where a halt
of at least several days had been made, and a considerable number
of readings taken. The means of all the recorded pressures and
air-temperatures were taken for each of these principal camps, and
the pressure corrected for instrumental error from the table above
given. The readings being taken at various times of the day, the
diurnal variation of pressure could safely be neglected, as it
would most probably disappear on taking the mean of the readings.
To allow for the annual variation, the mean pressures were next
reduced to the mean of the year by applying a correction based on
the mean of the normal annual variations at Siwa and El Obeid, as
found from the recent volume of “Climatological Normals” issued by
the Physical Department of Egypt and shown in the following

<p>A further correction to allow for the distribution of the
sea-level isobars over the region traversed was desirable, but no
sufficient data exist for estimating its amount; the distribution
is, however, probably nearly linear, and such a distribution was
approximately allowed for by assuming the previously accepted
levels at Siwa (-17 m.) and El Fasher (793 m.) to be correct and
distributing any residual difference found by the otherwise
corrected barometer readings between these two places uniformly
among the different sections.</p>

<p>The difference of height corresponding to each difference of
mean corrected barometer-readings was calculated by the tables of
<i>Barometrische Höhenstufen</i> in Jordan’s “Mathematische und
Geodätische Hülfstafeln,” for the air-temperature corresponding to
the mean of the thermometer-readings at the two ends of the
line.</p>

<p>The adopted levels of thirteen principal camps as found in the
above manner are tabulated below. It is interesting to note that
the residual difference of height which had to be distributed
between Siwa and El Fasher, and which is presumably mainly due to
systematic pressure-gradient, was sixty-three meters, corresponding
to a normal fall of sea-level pressure between the two places of
about 5 mm., and this is from other considerations probably very
near the truth; also that the resulting adjustment which had to be
made in the levels in any single main section of the route did not
exceed five meters.</p>

<p>After thus determining the levels for the principal camps, those
of intermediate camps and other places were computed in a similar
manner, adjusting each section to the adopted levels at its
terminal points. The maximum adjustment which it was found
necessary to apply to the difference of height given by the
barometer between points a day’s journey apart was five meters, and
the average three meters.</p>

<p>An exception was made in the stretch between Jaghbub and Jalo,
where no intermediate levels were adopted for the map, owing to the
extremely unstable state of the atmosphere during the journey
between these two places; sand-storms of great violence occurred on
several days of marching, with such rapid fluctuations of
air-pressure that no heights could safely be deduced from the
barometer-readings.</p>

<p>As regards the degree of reliability of the deduced levels, some
little uncertainty exists in the levels adopted for the terminal
points Siwa and El Fasher, while the temperature-compensation of
the aneroid has not been tested and may not be quite perfect.
Taking everything into account, it may be estimated that the levels
of the principal camps are probably correct to within about twenty
meters, while those of the intermediate camps and other points, for
which only one or two readings of the barometer are available, may
possibly be in error by twice that amount.</p>

<p class="app_section">8. Construction of the Route Map on Scale
1:2,000,000</p>

<p>In the process of utilizing the dead-reckoning for the
determination of the longitudes of the principal camps, the whole
route had been provisionally plotted on to a scale of 1:500,000
direct from the field-books, on a series of sheets each comprising
one section of the route. To these plottings of the actual route
were now added the computed levels of all camps, the geographical
features fixed by cross-bearings on either side of the route, and
notes on the nature of the ground. The various sections thus
provisionally mapped on 1:500,000 were then reduced to the scale of
1:2,000,000, allowance being made for the small departures of the
original plottings from the 1:500,000 scale as found by the
latitude-observations, and the various sections so reduced were
drawn in on the final map between the finally adopted positions of
the principal camps. It was found practicable to show all the
principal geographical features on the final scale, though many
notes on the nature of the ground had <a id="Page_329"></a>perforce
to be omitted in order not to overcrowd the map. These notes are
however carefully preserved on the 1:500,000 manuscript sectional
maps in the Desert Survey Office in Cairo, so as to be available
for future reference, while the principal of them are incorporated
in Hassanein Bey’s narrative of the expedition.</p>

<p>The main portion of the route, namely that from Jaghbub to
Furawia, has been mapped entirely from Hassanein Bey’s journals and
note-books. The portions of his route from Sollum to Jaghbub in the
north, and from Furawia to El Obeid in the south, have been copied
from the latest official survey maps of Egypt and the Sudan, as
being more accurate than any route survey could be.</p>

<p>The fixing of the positions of El Harrash and Taj by Hassanein
Bey’s observations has enabled the course of his former expedition
to Kufra (with Mrs. Forbes) in 1920-21 to be delineated more
accurately than was possible from the original records of that
journey, which were unaccompanied by any astronomical observations;
and the course of the former route, adjusted to newly determined
positions, has been indicated on the new map by a dotted line.</p>

<p><b>Jalo</b>.—The first portion of Hassanein Bey’s route from
Jaghbub to Jalo appears to be identical with that trodden by Rohlfs
in 1869. At Gara Matan Sidi, about half-way between Jaghbub and
Jalo, the track forks and Hassanein Bey went by the northern
(Zawaiya) branch, which passes Hiseila Wells and enters Jalo from a
more northerly direction than the southern (Majabra) branch taken
by Rohlfs.</p>

<p>Hassanein Bey’s position for Jalo is almost identical with that
of Rohlfs, but peculiar interest attaches to the former’s
determination of its level at sixty-one meters above sea. Rohlfs,
visiting the place in 1869 and 1879, had found the aneroid to
indicate a level below the sea in 1869, and above it in 1879, and
had ultimately concluded that both Aujila and Jalo lay about at
sea-level.<a id="FNanchor_04"></a><a href="#Footnote_04" class=
"fnanchor">[4]</a> Hassanein Bey’s determination is based on ten
days’ aneroid readings and comparison with Siwa, and it is
noteworthy that exactly the same altitude (sixty-one meters) for
Jalo results whether the comparison is made with the readings of
the standard barometer in the meteorological station at Siwa during
the same period, or with the readings taken by Hassanein Bey with
the same aneroid on four days at Siwa two months earlier (allowance
being made, of course, for the annual variation of pressure over
the intervening period). There can, I think, be hardly any doubt of
the greater accuracy of Hassanein Bey’s determination, since it is
unlikely that Rohlfs’s readings extended over so long a period, and
it is practically certain that no comparisons were made by him with
simultaneous observations at a place of known level. It should
however be mentioned that Hassanein Bey’s level probably refers to
a somewhat higher observation point than that of Rohlfs; for owing
to sand-drifts enveloping the houses, the inhabitants of El Erg are
gradually rebuilding their dwellings on higher ground, and his
observations were taken in one of the most recently constructed of
these. Another point worthy of remark is that although Hassanein
Bey’s determination is to a certain extent checked by the exact
agreement of the two methods of comparison above referred to, the
day-to-day variations of pressure observed at Jalo are much in
excess of those at Siwa during the same ten-day period. The extreme
range shown by the aneroid at Jalo was 10 mm. against 5 mm. of the
standard barometer at Siwa, and the 7 mm. average difference of
pressure between the two places for the ten days of comparison,
which has been used to calculate the new value of the level, is the
mean of difference ranging from 1 to 12 mm. on different days. The
relatively great variability of atmospheric pressure at Jalo, which
readily explains the discordant results noted by Rohlfs on
different dates, may be closely connected with the sand-storms
which are so frequent in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Bir Buttafal.—Bir Buttafal (“Battifal” of Rohlfs) is of
importance as being the last watering-place for caravans proceeding
on the weary desert march of nearly 400 km. to Zieghen. The
position found for Bir Buttafal by Hassanein Bey agrees fairly well
with that given by Rohlfs:<a id="FNanchor_05"></a><a href=

<p><b>Zieghen</b> (“Sirhen” of Rohlfs).—Zieghen is the name of a
district containing numerous wells. It is not inhabited, but is of
great importance as lying on the main caravan route from Jalo to
Kufra. The principal well used by the caravans is El Harrash.
Rohlfs did not visit Zieghen; he traveled from Jalo to Kufra by the
more westerly track through Taiserbo and Buseima, and the position
shown for Zieghen on his map, which was based merely on his guides’
statements, is about 100 km. too far to the east-northeast.</p>

<p>As the journey from Jalo to Kufra by any future traveler is
likely to be undertaken in the winter, when the <a id=
"Page_332"></a>question of fuel is second only to that of water, it
is worth noting that the first <i>hatab</i> (fire-wood) is met with
at about 342 km. after leaving Bir Buttafal, and 52 before reaching
El Harrash Well. In an emergency water may be got at Matan Abu
Hosh, the old well of Zieghen, about 18 km. before reaching El
Harrash; but El Harrash yields better water, and being the regular
halting-place of the caravans, the water can usually be obtained
there without digging; hence, unless the caravans are very thirsty
they usually prefer to go on to El Harrash rather than make a halt
at the old well. Excellent water can be got anywhere in the
neighborhood of El Harrash by digging to a depth of three or four
feet. From El Harrash to Buseima is about 54 km. in a direction a
little west of south, and from El Harrash to Taj, the principal
town of Kufra proper, is 182 km. in a southwesterly direction.</p>

<p><b>Taiserbo</b>.—Taiserbo, the most northwesterly oasis of the
Kufra group, has not, so far as is known, been visited by any
traveler since Rohlfs’s day. Its position was however indicated to
Hassanein Bey as lying between 70° and 80° west of north from El
Harrash, at a distance of 60 to 70 km. This indication would place
Taiserbo very nearly in the position which Rohlfs assigned to it.
Rohlfs’s position for his camp at Kasr Djrangedi is probably
therefore substantially correct, though it is likely that the oasis
is in reality less extensive than shown on his map.</p>

<p><b>Buseima</b>.—Although Buseima was not visited by Hassanein
Bey on this occasion, his fixation of the position of El Harrash,
in combination with his former rough compass-traverse from that
place to Buseima with Mrs. Forbes in 1921, permits of a fair
approximation for its position. Hassanein Bey’s estimates of
distances and bearings on his former journey (adjusted by his
recently observed latitudes at El Harrash and Taj) give his camp in
Buseima as being 60 km. from El Harrash in a direction of 5° east
of true south, and from his camp to that of Rohlfs (Ain El Nusrani)
was roughly about 15 km. in a true west-northwesterly direction.
Adopting Hassanein Bey’s recently fixed position for El Harrash,
this would give a position for Rohlfs’s camp about 30 km. southwest
by south of where Rohlfs placed it, as is shown by the following
comparison:</p>

<p>It would hardly seem possible that Hassanein Bey can have made
so large an error as 25 km. in his former estimation of the
distance of Buseima from El Harrash, and hence it would appear
reasonable to think that there was some error either in Stecker’s
observation or (what is more likely) in his reduction of it. This
point is referred to further on in the discussion of the position
of Boema <a href="#Page_334">(p. 334)</a>.</p>

<p><b>Kufra</b> (Kebabo of Rohlfs).—The name “Kufra” is now
generally applied, not to the whole of the Kufra group of oases as
was done by Rohlfs in 1879, but specially to the area called Kebabo
by that traveler.</p>

<p>The seat of local government and principal settlement is the
walled town of Taj, situated on a rocky cliff overlooking the
depression of the oasis proper which lies to the south and contains
the villages of Jof, Buma, Boema, El Zurruk, Talalib, and Tollab.
Hassanein Bey carried out latitude observations at Taj, and
proceeded 3 km., on a bearing of 16° west of south, to Jof, from
which place he <a id="Page_334"></a>made very careful estimations
of the distances and bearings of the other villages of the oasis,
which has enabled their relative positions to be plotted on the map
with much closer approximation than had hitherto been possible.</p>

<p>Considerable interest attaches to the position of Boema, the
easternmost village of Kufra, for it was here that Stecker camped
with Rohlfs and made his observations for latitude and longitude in
1879. Hassanein Bey found Boema to lie 2 km. from Taj, in a
direction 54° east of true south. Accepting his determination of
the position of Taj, this leads to the following position for Boema
as compared with that given by Rohlfs:</p>

<p>Hassanein Bey thus places Boema some 40 km. south-southeast of
the position assigned to it by Rohlfs from Stecker’s observations.
The remarkable thing about this large discrepancy is that it is
chiefly in the latitude, which was directly observed by Stecker at
Boema itself, and by Hassanein Bey at Taj, only 2 km. away from
Boema. I have not been able to find any details of Stecker’s
observations, except that they were carried out with a “prismatic
circle.” But I have subjected the original records of Hassanein
Bey’s observations for time and latitude at Taj to very careful
examination, and there is overwhelming evidence that his latitude
for that place cannot be in error by more than 1′. He observed the
altitude of Polaris at Taj on no fewer than six different nights,
with a watch whose error on local time was accurately known from
sun and star observations carried out on the same dates. From the
internal evidence of the observations themselves, the watch-error
at the time of sighting Polaris cannot on any occasion have been
uncertain by more than two seconds, which would not, of course,
sensibly affect the latitude found; the recorded magnetic bearing
of the star sighted, as well as its rate of apparent motion, proves
that the star used for latitude in each case was really Polaris;
and the greatest difference of any single observed latitude from
the mean of the six nights’ observations was only 15″, the average
departure of a single observation from the mean being 12″.
Hassanein Bey’s latitude of 24° 13′ 47″ for Taj can therefore be
unhesitatingly accepted as correct within 1′; and since there is
not room for an error of even this amount in his estimation of the
short distance of Boema from Taj, it becomes absolutely certain
that Rohlfs’s latitude for Boema is over a quarter of a degree too
high.</p>

<p>It is curious to notice that in the case of Buseima <a href=
"#Page_332">(p. 332)</a> the discrepancy of 13′ 31″ between
Rohlfs’s latitude and that estimated from Hassanein Bey’s recent
work is of the same order and of the same sign as that found at
Boema; and that a negative correction equal in amount to the sun’s
semidiameter would in each case bring the results of the two
observers into fairly close agreement. The explanation hence
suggests itself that Stecker may have determined his latitudes by
observation of the upper limb of the sun at noon, and both at
Buseima and Boema failed to correct the measured altitude for the
semidiameter, thus making both latitudes 16′ too great. A mistake
of this kind, as every scientific traveler knows, is very easily
made in hurried reductions in the field; and at the time when
Stecker carried out his observations and calculations in Kufra,
both he and his brave leader were in imminent peril of losing their
lives at the hands of treacherous Badawi.</p>

<p>A similar explanation may account to a large extent for the
discrepancies of longitude at the two places. Thus, according to
Hassanein Bey’s work, Rohlfs’s longitude for his camp at Buseima is
9′ too far east, and that for his camp at Boema 12′ too far west.
We have only to assume that Stecker observed the sun’s lower limb
in the morning at Buseima, and the upper limb in the afternoon at
Boema, for finding the local times, and in each case omitted to
correct the observed altitude for semidiameter, to account pretty
completely for both discrepancies of longitude.</p>

<p>The puzzling thing about the above explanation of the errors of
Rohlfs’s map is that Rohlfs actually traveled the distance between
Buseima and Boema, and estimated it at 120 km.,<a id=
"FNanchor_07"></a><a href="#Footnote_07" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
whereas Hassanein Bey’s positions would indicate that the true
distance is 40 km. greater. But as Rohlfs’s statement of the
distance was obviously written after Stecker had determined the
positions of the places astronomically, it is probable that he
obtained his 120 km. by calculation from the astronomical
positions, rejecting any rough estimate he may have made of the
distance from his times of marching. Both Hassanein Bey and Mrs.
Forbes had considered that the true distance was much greater than
120 km. when they traversed it in 1921; but as on that occasion no
observations for position were taken, it remained uncertain whether
either Buseima or Boema had been wrongly placed on Rohlfs’s map. It
is now practically certain that both were wrong.</p>

<p>As regards the level of Kufra, it is satisfactory to notice a
very close agreement of Hassanein Bey’s observations with those of
Rohlfs. Hassanein Bey’s barometer-readings at Ezeila, to the south
of Jof, give 389 meters for the level of that place, and he
estimates that Boema lies some ten meters higher; this would give
about four hundred meters for the altitude of Boema, a figure
identical with that found by Rohlfs. Taj, which has been built on
the cliff north of Jof, since Rohlfs’s day, is found to be 475
meters above sea-level from a series of aneroid-readings extending
over a fortnight. The outlying villages of Kufra which lie north of
Taj are lower than Taj itself, but substantially higher than the
southern villages of Kufra; Awadel is 434 meters above sea, and
Hawari and Hawawiri are about the same altitude.</p>

<p>There is also fairly close agreement as to the extent of Kufra
from north to south. Rohlfs’s map makes the extent in altitude
between Hawawiri and Tollab to be about 35 km., while Hassanein Bey
makes it 30 km. But when we come to the distance over which the
villages extend from east to west, there is a much graver
discrepancy. Rohlfs makes the extent from east to west (Buma to
Tollab) about 40 km., while according to the latest estimations by
Hassanein Bey the true extent is only about 21 km. As Rohlfs
appears to have located many of the villages on his map merely from
Arab statements, and not from careful personal estimation as did
Hassanein Bey, we need have no hesitation in accepting the latter’s
relative positions as by far the more nearly correct, and hence
concluding that Rohlfs’s map gives an east and west extension which
is nearly double the truth.</p>

<p>The error in east and west extension (so far as concerns the
placing of the villages, not the extent of the vegetation) is even
greater on the map prepared by me and published by Mrs. Forbes in
1921.<a id="FNanchor_08"></a><a href="#Footnote_08" class=
"fnanchor">[8]</a> This is due to the distance between Jof and
Tollab having been much overestimated on the former journey; it was
given to me as about 42 km., while according to Hassanein Bey’s
latest estimation it is only 20 km.</p>

<p>A matter which will at once strike the eye of any one who
compares Hassanein Bey’s latest map of the Kufra villages with that
published by Mrs. Forbes is that in the later map a place called
Ezeila is shown south of Jof, while in the earlier map (which was
prepared from Hassanein Bey’s own data and rough sketches) Ezeila
is shown north of Hawawiri. The explanation is that there are
<i>two</i> Ezeilas. The name “Ezeila” is applied locally to any
outlying well (usually with a clump of palms) which forms the last
watering place for caravans leaving the oasis. Thus the northern
Ezeila is the last well for a traveler leaving Kufra to go
northeastward toward Jaghbub, while the southern Ezeila is the last
well in Kufra for any one going south toward Wadai.</p>

<p>From the southern Ezeila of Kufra to Arkenu is 266 km. in a
nearly southeasterly direction, and there is no water or grazing on
the way. From Arkenu to Ouenat is a further 42 km. in a slightly
more southerly direction.</p>

<p><b>The Oases of Arkenu and Ouenat</b>.—One of the most
interesting and important results of Hassanein Bey’s expedition is
the confirmation of the real existence of the oases of Arkenu and
Ouenat, and a fairly exact determination of their positions and
altitudes. There has long been a tradition that two oases existed
in or near the southwestern corner of Egypt. Thus the map of Africa
on a scale of 1:4,000,000 published by Justus Perthes of Gotha in
1892 shows an unnamed small oasis and well in Lat. 21° 51′, Long.
23° 3′, and another “uninhabited oasis,” also unnamed, about 48 km.
due east of it in Lat. 21° 50′, Long. 23° 29′. Both these oases
were doubtless placed on the map from vague Arab statements; they
appear not to have been previously visited by any explorer, and
indeed their very existence was so doubtful that they have not been
shown on the maps either of the English or of the French General
Staff.</p>

<p>I have not been able to trace any published reference to the
existence of Arkenu, but that of Ouenat has been mentioned in
recent papers by Mr. Harding King and Lieutenant-Colonel Tilho. In
Mr. Harding King’s paper of 1913 <a id="FNanchor_09"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_09" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> on “The Libyan Desert from
Native Information,” he states that he heard of a place called
“Owana” or “Owanat,” about half-way along a road from Merga to
Kufra, where there is a well and green grass after rain. The map
appended to his paper shows that Mr. Harding King’s estimate of its
probable position was Lat. 21° 37′, Long. 24° 45′, which differs by
nearly 130 km. from the nearer of the two oases shown on the
above-mentioned German map.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-Colonel Tilho, who carried out exploratory work in
Tibesti, Erdi, Borkou and Ennedi in 1912-17, mentions<a id=
"FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
“the still unknown massif of El Aouinat, situated approximately
between the 22nd and 23rd degrees of latitude north and the 24th
and 25th degrees of longitude east,” and a route he heard of from
Aouinat to Merga.</p>

<p>Hassanein Bey’s observations give for the positions and altitude
of his camps at Arkenu and Ouenat:</p>

<p>Thus Ouenat is only some 34 km. from where Mr. Harding King
guessed its position to be from his guide’s statements, but it is
outside the somewhat wide limits of latitude indicated by
Lieutenant-Colonel Tilho, and is nearly 150 km. from the place
marked “uninhabited oasis” on the German map; while Arkenu, which
is presumably the small oasis marked to the west of the
“uninhabited oasis,” is now proved to be some 180 km. from where it
is shown on that map.</p>

<p>It may be remarked that Arkenu is well within the boundaries of
Egypt, while Ouenat is a short distance over the boundary, in the
Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.</p>

<p>The principal interest in these places lies in the possibilities
they open up for further exploration of the southwest corner of
Egypt, which has hitherto been inaccessible to military patrols,
and even to the boldest of explorers, by reason of the absence of
any certain knowledge as to the existence and position of permanent
water-supplies. Now that Arkenu and Ouenat are exactly located,
with the existence of drinkable water in reasonable quantities, it
may be possible for a traveler from Egypt to reach them and procure
the necessary water-supplies for his return journey. I say it
<i>may</i> be possible, for there are still great difficulties
about access to Arkenu and Ouenat from Egypt, although both the
compilers of the German map and Mr. Harding King were informed that
an old track to Egypt runs from Ouenat. According to Mr. Harding
King’s informant, the track runs to Dakhla Oasis, which is a
distance of some 600 km. through a waterless desert, and
consequently the journey between the two places is a very
formidable undertaking for camels, even in winter; while the
suitability of the ground for motor-cars, especially in the
mountainous region round the oases themselves, is as yet
unknown.</p>

<p>An interesting feature of Arkenu and Ouenat is that they are not
depressions with underground water-supplies, like all the other
oases of the Western Desert of Egypt, but mountainous areas where
the water is dependent on local rainfall and collected in natural
basins in the rocks.<a id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11"
class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The Nile Valley in the same latitudes has
practically no rainfall, but here, some 700 km. westward into the
Sahara, there is sufficient rain to maintain perennial though
limited supplies—at Ouenat even sufficient for the needs of a
settlement of some one hundred and fifty Badawi—and at certain
seasons to provide grazing for animals in the valleys and lowlands.
The ground-level in this region is high (six hundred meters above
sea-level), but the mountains near the oases rise to heights of
over eleven hundred meters above the sea, and it can hardly be
doubted that the rainfall is connected with the orography, the
mountains attracting or helping to form clouds. In this connection
it is worth noting that in the more open country further south, as
well as in that to the north, the absence of vegetation shows that
rainfall is evidently much scarcer than in the mountains around the
oases; also that Ouenat, where the mountains are higher than at
Arkenu, possesses better and more abundant water. The conservation
of the water through the dry season is partly conditioned by the
almost impermeable nature of the crystalline rocks composing the
mountains, and partly by the sheltered position of the pools in the
rocky gullies, which diminishes evaporation.</p>

<p>The full extent of the mountains of Arkenu and Ouenat is not yet
known, but they cover at least 1000 square km. Hassanein Bey’s main
route lay along the western feet of the masses, so that their
western limit is ascertained, as also their north and south
extension; but their eastern limits in Egypt are unknown, and it is
not yet certain whether there may be a continuous chain of hills
connecting the two masses to the east. Hassanein Bey made a round
reconnaissance extending some 40 km. eastward of his camp at
Ouenat, without reaching the limits of the mass. The mountains are
visible from great distances from the north and south, Arkenu
having been sighted from at least 60 km. north, and Ouenat remained
visible for at least the same distance on the track southward from
it. There is a possibility that the mountains may be less
conspicuous to a traveler approaching from the east, owing to their
breaking up into smaller hills and the ground on that side of them
being higher and falling away gradually toward the Nile; but this
must remain uncertain until further exploration is undertaken.</p>

<p>From Ouenat to Erdi “Well” is a journey of 439 km. in a
south-southwesterly direction, the first 284 km. being in the
Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, the remaining 146 in French Equatorial
Africa. There is no water in all this stretch, but patches of dried
grass were met with at intervals in the latter half of the journey,
and some 25 km. before reaching Erdi the valleys were full of green
grass. Thus the northern limit of the equatorial rain-belt
hereabouts is approximately in Lat. 18° 50′.</p>

<p><b>Erdi</b>.—Erdi appears to be the name given to an extensive
tract of country stretching between the twenty-first and
twenty-fourth meridians of east longitude, rising gradually
southward and ending in a broken east and west escarpment in about
Lat. 18° 30′. The water-source visited by Hassanein Bey, called by
the guide “Erdi Well,” is in Lat. 18° 31′, Long. 23° 10′, and is
958 meters above sea-level. It is not really a well, but a
rock-pool, similar to those of Arkenu and Ouenat; the water is
good.</p>

<p>Hassanein Bey’s “Erdi Well” is close to the locality marked
“Erdi-ma” on Lieutenant-Colonel Tilho’s map of 1920, but it appears
not to be the same water-source as the one visited by that
traveler. Erdi Well is at the head of a small valley draining
northward, and one has to ascend the hills to a height of 1020
meters above sea and cross a stretch of broken plateau before
reaching the southward drainages which cut back into the scarp.
Over this broken plateau Hassanein Bey proceeded in a southeasterly
direction, descending the scarp in Lat. 18° 25′, Long. 23° 20′. The
level at the foot of the scarp was 790 meters, so that the scarp
hereabouts is some 230 meters in height.</p>

<p>After descending the Erdi scarp, Hassanein Bey’s track southward
across the great sandy depression which separates the Erdi plateau
from that of Ennedi, to Agah (88 km. from his camp north of Erdi
Well), appears to have been almost parallel to, and some 20 km.
east of, that followed by Lieutenant-Colonel Tilho in 1914.</p>

<p><b>Agah</b>.—The water-source of Agah is a rock-pool similar to
that at Erdi; but the water is bad, owing to fouling by animals.
The pool is some 6 km. up a valley cutting back northward into the
scarp which faces that of Erdi. The position found for the pool at
Agah lies some 24 km. from the “Aga Spring” shown on
Lieutenant-Colonel Tilho’s map. There are possibly several springs
and pools among the hills in this neighborhood, all bearing the
same name, which would explain the apparent discrepancy.</p>

<p>From Agah the track to Enebah (65 km.) runs in a rather zigzag
course with a general southward trend. For the first 10 km. beyond
the pool, the track ascends the valley; then, mounting rapidly, it
soon reaches altitudes of over a thousand meters on the
plateau.</p>

<p><b>Enebah</b>.—Here is a small settlement of Badawi and a well
of good water about 28 km. east of the wells of Keita shown on
Lieutenant-Colonel Tilho’s map, on the same high plateau.</p>

<p>From Enebah to Bao is 120 km., by a rather zigzag track in a
general south-southwesterly direction over an undulating and hilly
plateau. The greatest altitude recorded by Hassanein Bey during his
entire journey, 1184 meters above sea, was reached at a point on
the road about 18 km. from Enebah. This altitude (3884 feet) is
slightly higher than that (3600 feet) which Lieutenant-Colonel
Tilho records as his maximum on the same (Erdebe) plateau at a
point further west; so that the plateau probably increases in
height to the eastward. The Kaptarko valley was crossed about 47
km. further on, and it is interesting to note that Hassanein Bey’s
data give a position for this which is very close to the “Kapterko”
of Lieutenant-Colonel Tilho’s map.</p>

<p><b>Bao</b>.—Hassanein Bey’s Bao is not the “Bo” visited by
Lieutenant-Colonel Tilho, which lies over 100 km. further north,
but the place called “Orobo” on Tilho’s map and “Bao” on the map of
Wadai and Darfur which was attached to the convention between the
British and French Governments at Paris in 1919; this is evident
from the following comparison of Hassanein Bey’s position with
those scaled for the above-mentioned places from the maps referred
to:</p>

<p>The wells of Bao are at the head of a small valley draining
northward, in which shrubs and trees are plentiful. There are
several wells, with perennial supplies, though the water becomes
scarce in the dry season and the wells have then to be
deepened.</p>

<p>From Bao to Furawia is 145 km. in a south-southeasterly
direction, over ground partly covered with grass and small trees.
About 55 km. before reaching Furawia, Hassanein Bey passed close to
a hill called Tameira, on which is a sign-post, formed of a dead
tree, marking the boundary between French and Anglo-Egyptian
territory. No astronomical observations were taken here, but
Hassanein Bey’s adjusted traverse-data indicate the approximate
position of the hill to be Lat. 15° 48′ N., Long. 23° 27′ E. The
Wadai Hawar (“Howa” of the Anglo-French convention map) was crossed
about 7 km. beyond Tameira Hill.</p>

<p><b>Conclusion</b>.—In concluding this analysis of Hassanein
Bey’s results, the reduction of which has occupied a large part of
my time for over two months, I may be permitted to remark that his
expedition appears to me to be an almost unique achievement in the
annals of geographical exploration. The journey of 3345 km. from
Sollum to El Obeid, most of it through inhospitable deserts
sparsely inhabited by fanatical and predatory tribes, is one which,
without a strong military escort, could have been undertaken only
by a Moslem, and by one of remarkable grit, tact, and perseverance.
But Hassanein Bey has not only accomplished this difficult journey
and brought back interesting descriptions and photographs of the
country through which he passed. Before setting out from Cairo he
had applied himself strenuously for several weeks to acquiring
facility in the use of the theodolite, and instruction in the
particular methods of reconnaissance-survey best adapted for
exploration of the kind on which he was to embark; and throughout
his travels he made excellent use of the surveying knowledge thus
acquired. How complete and accurate were his observations will be
obvious from the foregoing analysis; and the really remarkable
thing is that he managed somehow to carry out all this observation
single-handed, and to maintain the continuity and accuracy of his
measurements and records over the distance of more than 2000 km.
which separates the points on his route whose positions were
previously known. Thanks to the detailed and systematic character
of his observations, their reduction has been a pleasant labor, and
it has been comparatively easy to map his route and the newly
discovered places along it with a high degree of accuracy.</p>

<p>The principal additions to our knowledge of northeastern Africa
which have resulted from the expedition are:</p>

<p>(1) The true positions of Zieghen and Kufra, resulting in
changes of about 100 and 40 kms. respectively from the positions
hitherto assigned to these places on maps of Africa.</p>

<p>(2) The discovery of the oases of Arkenu and Ouenat, previously
unknown, and the determination of their positions and approximate
extent, thus opening up possibilities of new desert travel from
Egypt into regions of the Libyan Desert still unexplored.</p>

<p>(3) The discovery of a route from southwestern Egypt across the
Erdi and Ennedi plateaux of French Equatorial Africa into Darfur,
and the positions of the water-sources along it. Incidentally, this
establishes a connection with, and extension of, Lieutenant-Colonel
Tilho’s recent brilliant explorations in the French Sudan.</p>

<p>(4) The determination of careful barometric levels along the
entire route, affording valuable information on the orography of a
vast region of which little was previously known, and confirming
Lieutenant-Colonel Tilho’s conclusion that there is no possible
drainage-outlet from Lake Chad in an easterly direction.</p>

<h2><a id="append2"></a>APPENDIX II</h2>

<p class="sc center">Conclusions Derived from the Geological Data
Collected by Hassanein Bey during His Kufra-Ouenat Expedition</p>

<p class="center">W. F. Hume, D.Sc., Director, Geological Survey of
Egypt</p>

<p>Before dealing with the facts ascertained I would desire to
congratulate Hassanein Bey on the successful accomplishment of an
expedition which has given us knowledge of a large tract of country
hitherto unknown to geographical science. Those of us who have a
slight acquaintance with desert travel will appreciate the fact
that he should have covered 3500 km. over an almost waterless waste
in a region which from religious or political causes is practically
closed to a European explorer. It has often meant weariness of body
and anxiety of mind, though no doubt he has been compensated by the
freedom of feeling engendered by free wind-swept spaciousness and
by the constant interest of new discovery.</p>

<p>Hassanein Bey has shown a keen desire to obtain data which would
be of scientific value, and consequently has collected specimens
and taken photographs which might enable those familiar with the
desert geology in Egypt to arrive at conclusions as to the
geological nature of the country traversed. Mr. Moon has examined
these specimens in my absence, and his notes and conclusions are
attached.</p>

<p>The following points are those which have struck me most
forcibly in looking over the specimens and photographs brought back
by Hassanein Bay:</p>

<p>(1) Between Siwa and Jaghbub large specimens of petrified trees
were noted and photographed. This is of interest as showing the
wide extension to the west of the so-called “petrified forests.” It
emphasizes the desirability of extending the examination of the
southern edge of the Cyrenaic scarp to the western boundary of
Egyptian territory, including the portion now marked “unexplored”
on the 1:1,000,000 geological map of Egypt.</p>

<p>(2) The beautiful specimens of the Miocene oysters <i>Ostrea
Virleti</i> and <i>Ostrea digitalina</i> indicate clearly that
Jaghbub is on the same formation as that of Siwa, viz., Middle
Miocene, while the further continuation of these strata toward Jalo
is indicated by Specimen No. 3.</p>

<p>(3) At a point a little south of Lat. 28° N., a collection was
made of hard limestone. A very shelly piece among them may be
Miocene, but the others might well form part of the Eocene or
Cretaceous members which are so well developed on the same latitude
to the east of the Egyptian boundary. The absence of type fossils
in the rocks renders further identification impossible.</p>

<p>(4) Between March 20 and 24 Hassanein Bey was crossing a flat
plain. The question arises whether this might not be due to erosion
of the finer clays and sands which so often lie between the hard
Cretaceous limestone and more compact members of the Nubian
Sandstone series.</p>

<p>(5) Be this as it may, as indicated by Mr. Moon, the Nubian
Sandstone proper was met with in typical form a little north of El
Harrash (Zieghen). The specimens obtained from this point onward to
the junction with the igneous rocks about 30 km. north of Arkenu
are all varied members of the same sandstone formation which in
Egypt proper and the Sudan spreads over enormous areas.</p>

<p>(6) Great interest attaches to the discovery of typical granite
in the oases of Ouenat and Arkenu. The main rock is of pegmatitic
type, being composed of well-shaped felspars, glassy quartz, and
hornblende. A point brought out by the photograph is the intense
action of temperature variation on these igneous rocks. The whole
of the hillside is strewn with gigantic boulders, some of which
have been split into large pieces which obviously once formed part
of the same block.</p>

<p>As regards the nature of the relations between the granite and
the Nubian Sandstone, it is to be noted that the granite difference
of level might be explained (a) by the existence of a fold, (b) by
the presence of a fracture line or fault, (c) by intrusion of the
granite when in a molten condition into the overlying
sandstone.</p>

<p>After conversation with Hassanein Bey, and a closer examination
of his photographs from this point of view, one is led to the
following conclusion:</p>

<p>(1) A fold seems possible, because the sandstone (which dips or
slopes off the granite in certain folds in the south of Kharga
Oasis) is seen to be obviously dipping toward the spectator in the
cinema photograph of camels coming through the valley of Ouenat.
Taking (c) first, we have no proof anywhere in Egypt that granite
has been intruded into the Nubian Sandstone, in all cases where the
relations are clearly displayed the granite having obviously been
worn down before the sandstone was deposited on it.</p>

<p>(2) We are consequently disposed to adopt the view, pending
further study, that the differences of level may be due to the
existence of a fold. The alternative would be the presence of a
fracture line, along which the granite has been pushed up in a
solid form to a higher level than the sandstone which normally
overlies it, or the sandstone has been led down along the line of
weakness against the granite.</p>

<p>A very interesting feature is the presence of well-made drawings
of giraffes and ostriches on the granite boulders. As Hassanein Bey
points out, the camel is absent, and it is to be regretted that
there are no pictures of human beings. These <i>graffiti</i> may be
of ancient date, being drawn at a period when rainfall was greater
in this portion of North Africa than it is at present.</p>

<p>Hassanein Bey’s expedition has thus indicated that both the
Miocene strata in the north and the great Nubian Sandstone
formation further south continue well to the west of the western
Egyptian boundary with unchanged characteristics, while the
discovery of the granitic oasis, as I understand within the
boundaries of Egyptian territory, opens up the possibility of
developing alternative routes to Darfur from Dakhla Oasis, and also
indicates a water-base of great importance in connection with the
exploration of the unknown territory lying west of the route
followed by Hassanein Bey. Its further study from the geological
standpoint would be of great interest.</p>

<h2><a id="append3"></a>APPENDIX III</h2>

<p class="sc center">Notes on the Geology of Hassanein Bey’s
Expedition, Sollum-Darfur, 1923</p>

<p class="center">F. W. Moon</p>

<p>Having been requested by Hassanein Bey, in the absence of Dr.
Hume, to report upon the interesting geological specimens collected
by him on his recent exploratory tour through the Western Desert
from Sollum, on the southern shores of the Mediterranean Sea, to
Darfur in the Sudan, I have much pleasure in submitting the
following short summary of the main features of the journey from a
geological point of view, as deduced from the specimens
collected.</p>

<p>Although the specimens are small and, in the case of the igneous
rocks, much weathered, yet for all intents and purposes they are
quite sufficient to enable one to make deductions and conclusions
as to the main geological formations passed over.</p>

<p>As the explorer explains, there was not the freedom of transport
he would have desired for making a larger collection of full-sized
specimens, nor did he wish to incur the displeasure of those who
formed his escort by seeming to do anything that might appear in
any way suspicious, such as the constant breaking and collecting of
stones.</p>

<p>From the tabulated list of specimens herewith appended, it may
be seen that the beginning of the journey was made over Miocene
formations indicated by fossil oysters and pectens (identified as
<i>Ostrea digitalina</i>, <i>O. Virleti</i>, <i>Chlamys
zitteli</i>, and others), of which there are seven valves of the
former, two of the second, two of the third, and five which
resemble <i>Chlamys sub-malvina</i>.</p>

<p>The Miocene formations continue through Siwa, Jaghbub, and Jalo,
and far southward to a point about 180 km. to the south of Jalo
(see Specimens 1-4), where the last Miocene specimen (No. 4) was
picked up.</p>

<p>At this point begins a wide barren stretch of flat and desolate
country, devoid of rocks of any particular geological interest
beyond the thin covering of “sand and alluvium” which extends for
nearly 200 km. (four days of monotonous marching) along the route
to the south.</p>

<p>Then, when about 50 km. north of Zieghen, the explorer noticed
that the aspect of the country took a sudden change; the light
yellow of the Miocene limestones and desert sands gave place to
brighter, more varied, and highly colored scenery, which the
specimens show was due to the approach of the Lower Cretaceous
Nubian Sandstones, which, wherever they occur, add beauty to the
landscape in unbelievable brilliancy and variety of coloring.</p>

<p>Although greens and blues are sometimes observed, red is the
dominant color, all shades of pink, terra-cotta, maroon, and brick
red are blended together, and umbers and ochers are sometimes
present.</p>

<p>Thus we are provided with a point well westward of any hitherto
known on the northern limits of the Nubian Sandstone; in other
words, the evidence suggests the continuation westward by some 600
km. of the Nubian boundary shown on the existing 1:1,000,000
colored geological map of Egypt (1910).</p>

<p>Mention may here be made of the apparent absence of specimens
definitely representing the younger Cretaceous rocks which are
shown colored green, on the map just referred to, to the east; but
this may be readily accounted for by the presence of the expansive
plain passed over between Jalo and Zieghen, the “sand and alluvium”
covering of which is quite sufficient to hide all evidence of the
younger rocks of that age.</p>

<p>Another question rendered obscure by the presence of this large
flat expanse of “sand and alluvium” is the exact position of the
southern limits of Miocene formations. If we assume (which seems to
be the case) that the point, 180 km. to the south of Jalo, where
the last Miocene specimens were collected, be the southern boundary
of the Miocene, then we find that the distribution of that
formation as now suggested is of particular interest as (1)
indicating a western extension of the general outline of the
ancient Mediterranean Ocean in Miocene time; and (2) adding extra
weight to our conceptions as regard the period (in geological
chronology) of the Egyptian-Sinai uplift which caused the elevation
of land involving a considerable portion of Egypt in pre-Miocene
times, and ultimately defining the shores of the Miocene Sea more
or less as we now follow it from this newly discovered spot between
El Harrash (Zieghen) and Jalo to a short distance east of Siwa from
where it runs northeastward to the thirtieth degree of latitude,
along which it continues with little variation to Suez.</p>

<p>It would appear that all Egypt lying between the Miocene Gulf of
Suez in the east and the Siwa-Zieghen Miocene shore-line in the
west and southward was dry land in Miocene times, and therefore
exposed to denudation extending over a vast geological period
during which the Nubian Sandstone and younger Cretaceous rocks were
laid bare and in a position to have Miocene strata laid down upon
or against them.</p>

<p>The Nubian Sandstone, as indicated by the Specimens 5-10, shows
identical characteristics to those exhibited wherever it occurs in
Egypt or Sinai. It is a sandstone consisting in the main of more or
less fine rounded grains of pure quartz, through which are
distributed, in greater or lesser proportions, larger grains or
pebbles. In cases where the latter predominate, a pudding-stone or
conglomerate results; where the larger grains are sparsely
distributed, a porphyritic appearance is suggested.</p>

<p>The cementing material, which may be either calcareous,
silicious, or ferruginous, is the color-imparting medium, the depth
of color depending upon the amount and composition of iron oxides
present in it, and when this material is weathered, washed out, and
accumulated into pockets it becomes, when finely ground, suitably
adapted for the manufacture of paints.</p>

<p>The Nubian Sandstone continues south of the Miocene-Nubian
boundary above referred to, to a point some 15 km. north of the
Arkenu Mountains.</p>

<p>Approaching this point, still another change in the general
aspect of the country met the eye of the explorer: the brighter
coloring of the sandstones gave place to the duller browns, grays,
and blacks of an abrupt range of igneous hills, the position on the
ground where the igneous rocks come up through the Nubian
Sandstones being approximately 25 km. north of Arkenu.</p>

<p>The changes of scenery in passing from one formation to another
are strikingly seen in the excellent collection of photographs
procured by Hassanein Bey, who is to be highly complimented on the
success he obtained under great difficulties and
inconveniences.</p>

<p>Judging from the Specimens 11-12 submitted for examination, the
igneous rocks, of which the Arkenu-Ouenat Hills are composed,
consist mainly of coarsely crystalline granites and syenites
varying in texture and appearance, and through them run intrusive
veins of finer-grained dike rocks.</p>

<p>The Arkenu Hills are mostly composed of rocks represented by
Specimens 12 and 14, which are really somewhat similar in
composition.</p>

<p>No. 12 consists of a holocrystalline aggregate of large crystals
of a light gray (possibly a decomposed or kaolinized orthoclase)
alkali-felspar, which constitutes the main bulk of the rock. No
quartz is visible in the hand specimen, which is greatly weathered,
and only gives a specific gravity of a little over 2.5. Small
crystals of dark greenish hornblende are well formed, and occur in
fewer numbers than in Specimens 17 and 21, which are
representatives of the rockmass of the Ouenat Hills to be described
presently.</p>

<p>Specimen 14 is an unweathered gray rock chiefly composed of a
mottled gray alkali-felspar, with hornblende crystals in similar
numbers to those in Specimen 12.</p>

<p>The microscopic examination of a rock-section made from Specimen
14 corroborates the above description, but introduces the
possibility of the presence of nephelin in granular-like patches in
the slide, which correspond to darker slightly lustrous areas in
the hard specimen; however, no nephelin has been actually
identified.</p>

<p>Specimens Nos. 12 and 14 may therefore be called syenites.</p>

<p>Running through the syenites of the Arkenu Hills are veins of
intrusive rocks represented by Specimens Nos. 11, 13, and 15, and
no doubt many others occur.</p>

<p>Specimen No. 11 represents a vein of a hemicrystalline, hard
dark green rock weathering brown on the outer surface, with
innumerable small dark specks which are scarcely discernible in the
unweathered portion of the specimen.</p>

<p>Under the microscope this rock is found to be of considerable
interest. It consists of an aggregate of small phenocrysts of
idiomorphic felspar, which in places assumes the appearance of a
crypto- or microcrystalline felspathic matrix crowded with acicular
crystals of a green mineral resembling ægirine. The latter are in
places irregularly distributed, but in areas where the felspar
occurs in roughly rectangular or lozenge form, the ægirine
microlites are crowded round the edges of the latter.</p>

<p>No quartz is noticeable in the rock-slide, and the rock may be
tentatively determined as an ægirine-felsite, apparently similar to
a rock described and figured in Harker’s “Petrology for
Students.”</p>

<p>A second vein in the Arkenu Hills is represented by Specimen No.
13, which is a brownish quartzite.</p>

<p>The third vein is indicated by Specimen No. 15, which is a dark
gray laminated rock, weathering to reddish brown, very fine in
texture, with small clear crystals of phenocrysts sparsely
disseminated through the ground-mass. The rock-slide shows, under
the microscope, a great similarity to Specimen No. 11 as described
above. The felspar here, however, forms a much finer
crypto-crystalline ground-mass than in the former, and the ægirine
microlites are smaller, tapering, and not so well formed. This rock
may also be tentatively called a fine ægirine-felsite.</p>

<p>The Ouenat Hills are mainly composed of rocks represented by
Specimens 17 and 21, the chief constituent of which is a gray
alkali-felspar (possibly orthoclase with some microcline). Quartz
is well represented in idiomorphic forms; no mica is noticeable in
the hand specimens, but many well-developed prismoidal crystals of
very dark or dark green hornblende are thickly distributed
throughout the mass.</p>

<p>No slide was made of these specimens owing to their fragile
condition on account of weathering, but the rock may be determined
as a coarsely crystalline gray hornblende granite.</p>

<p>Specimen No. 18 is another representative rock from, and
constitutes a considerable bulk of, the Ouenat Hills. It may be
termed a red granite, approximating to an aplite with very little
mica, which decomposes and forms oxides of iron which have stained
the rock a brownish red; quartz and felspar form the main bulk of
the rock.</p>

<p>As in the case of the Arkenu syenites, so here in the Ouenat
granites we find other examples of endogenous veins running through
the parent rock, represented by Specimens 16, 19, and 22.</p>

<p>Specimen No. 16 represents a vein of purplish felsite, in the
felsitic ground-mass of which occur phenocrysts of idiomorphic
felspar.</p>

<p>Specimen No. 19 represents a vein of pure white granular quartz
rock which occurs in and may have been the cause (through
denudation) of the cave found in the foot-hills of the Ouenat
range.</p>

<p>Specimen No. 22, found at Garet Shezzu, is a typical quartzite
which may also occur as a vein in the granites.</p>

<p>Two specimens found inside the cave in the Ouenat Oasis are of
particular interest. These specimens are Nos. 20 and 21. The
former, a laminated travertine, could only have been deposited from
running water, as the formation of ripple-markings confirms; and
from notes made by the explorer at the time of his inspection, we
learn that there was quite a lot of it lying about on the floor of
the cave. Under the microscope spheroidal structure is displayed,
representing the ripple-markings, and in the matrix of calcite many
fragments of quartz, felspar, etc., are conspicuous, these having
been derived from the denuding granites. No organic remains were
observed.</p>

<p>The second specimen (No. 21) is a fragment of the hornblendic
granite of which the Ouenat Hills are chiefly composed, and which
forms the roof of the cave; this is coated on one side with a thin
black iron-manganese film, similar to the well-known deposit on the
rocks in the Nile at or near the Asswan Dam.</p>

<p>This whole igneous area, which includes the newly discovered
mountains and oases of Arkenu and Ouenat, is possibly of limited
extent, and occurs in, and is possibly surrounded by, a much wider
expanse of Nubian Sandstone, in a similar manner to several other
such areas already shown on the 1:1,000,000 geological map of
Egypt.</p>

<p>Judging from other known similar occurrences where igneous rocks
appear surrounded by Nubian Sandstones, we may infer that the
latter were deposited upon the ancient igneous rocks which
subsequently rose vertically, bending the superincumbent strata
over and round them, possibly only to a slight degree in this
instance, as none of the photographs show very highly dipping
rocks.</p>

<p>On leaving Ouenat for Erdi the igneous area is soon left behind.
The actual junction between it and the Nubian Sandstone (which
again forms the surface rock) occurs at a point about 20 km. south
of Ouenat, and the aspect of the country again changes from the
more uneven weathering of the igneous range of grays and browns to
brilliant colorings of the Nubian Sandstone which forms a long
series of prominent escarpments rising to heights bordering on 1000
meters above the sea between Enebah and Kuttum, after which the
ground begins to fall, until El Fasher is reached, where the
ground-level is only about 700 or 800 meters in height.</p>

<p><b>Summary</b>.—The several interesting geological features
suggested by the recent expedition may be summarized as
follows:</p>

<p>1. That Miocene rocks extend southward, to or near the
twenty-seventh degree of north latitude, forming a large bay
bordered by older rocks.</p>

<p>2. That the Miocene rocks, resting here apparently upon or
against Nubian Sandstones, seem to follow the same conditions
noticed first by Dr. Hume in the Gulf of Suez region, namely, that
they rest upon older and older formations the further southward
they are found; in other words, that prior to the deposition of the
Miocene there was a time of denudation which was more effectual in
the south than in the north, owing to the fact that in the south
was an area of greater uplift.</p>

<p>3. That a large area of Nubian Sandstone (Cretaceous) exists
south of this latitude.</p>

<p>4. That a newly discovered range of igneous rocks in the Arkenu
Hills exists well inside Egyptian territory, and possibly entirely
within this Nubian Sandstone area, or connected as a tongue to a
larger igneous massif lying in the south.</p>

<p>5. That the Cretaceous rocks (younger than the Nubian Sandstone)
which appear on the colored Geological Map of Egypt further to the
northeast, possibly do not occur along the route traversed, having
been concealed beneath “sand and alluvium” areas.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_01"></a><a href="#FNanchor_01"><span class=
"label">[1]</span></a> Since the above was written, I have received
information from the director of Sudan surveys that a recent
extension of the Sudan triangulation-net includes Gebel Furawia as
one of the points, and that the precise position found for the
summit of the hill is Lat. 15° 20′ 59.9″ N., Long. 23° 36′ 48.1″
E., altitude 954 meters above sea-level. This position differs by
about 2 km. from that shown on the map above referred to; but in
view of the fact that the distance and bearing of Hassanein Bey's
camp from the hill is unknown, though his observed latitude shows
his camp to have been on a parallel about a kilometer and a half
north of the hill, I have not thought it worth while to make any
change in the adjustment of Hassanein Bey’s data. The longitude
adopted for the camp <a href="#Page_320">(p. 320)</a> may be
slightly in error, but it is unlikely that the error can exceed a
mile or so. The difference of level between the top of the hill and
Hassanein Bey’s camp being unknown, the triangulation-level affords
no control over Hassanein Bey’s barometric value for the latter
place, and consequently I have judged it best to use El Fasher as
the south control point in adjusting the level-determinations.</p>

from a car-and-compass traverse carried out by Captain Williams
from Zuetina in 1918.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
